This repository contains some concepts of Artificial Intelligence mainly Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms. 
I have applied the algorithms on various datasets found on the internet and other sources.
Hope this helps you while lerning the concepts. Most of the files also include comments so you can understand the code. If in case of any doubts, feel free to

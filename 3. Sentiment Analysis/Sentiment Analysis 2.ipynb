any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \\r\\nfellini\\'s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \\r\\neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \\r\\ncharacters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta\\'s sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \\r\\nevery now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie\\'s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters\\' visions . \\r\\nbecause of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \\r\\neven the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini\\'s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \\r\\nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \\r\\nunlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn\\'t care that much about politics . \\r\\nlack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini\\'s humanistic approach to his characters . \\r\\neach of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \\r\\nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \\r\\nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \\r\\nfellini couldn\\'t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \\r\\nvignettes aren\\'t memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character\\'s fantasies . \\r\\nfellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \\r\\neven the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \\r\\non the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \\r\\nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini\\'s long-time associate nino rota . \\r\\nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \\r\\nthat music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\n[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] \\r\\nwar is a topic that can\\'t help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . \\r\\nmovies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . \\r\\nit\\'s easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . \\r\\nforgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number . \\r\\n \" saving private ryan \" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . \\r\\nit proves there\\'s a huge difference between battling and killing . \\r\\nthe film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . \\r\\nit\\'s world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . \\r\\nspielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . \\r\\ninstead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . \\r\\nthere is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . \\r\\n \" poor \" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . \\r\\nthere is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . \\r\\nwe don\\'t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . \\r\\nthe nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they\\'re there . \\r\\nin the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn\\'t happen . \\r\\nthe men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . \\r\\nthey are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they\\'re shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . \\r\\nperhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . \\r\\nthe film seems to rely on the audience\\'s sense of patriotism , that the american military is \" right \" and good and that the nazis are \" inherently evil . \" \\r\\nthe battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . \\r\\ni have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn\\'t help but feel some sense of joy and relief . \\r\\nto triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there\\'s nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . \\r\\none of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . \\r\\nthe plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . \\r\\ntom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . \\r\\nhe\\'s never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . \\r\\nhe doesn\\'t want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . \\r\\nthe mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . \\r\\nthrough a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general\\'s attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each\\'s death simultaneously . \\r\\nwhen they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . \\r\\nit\\'s easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . \\r\\nbut finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , \" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . \" \\r\\nthe saving of private ryan isn\\'t just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . \\r\\nhis salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . \\r\\nwhen miller\\'s company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn\\'t so quick to shrug it off . \\r\\nhe knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone\\'s sense of hope a reality . \\r\\nthe mission to find ryan gives miller\\'s group a destination , but not direction . \\r\\nalong the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . \\r\\na few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . \\r\\nthe act of killing itself becomes one of the film\\'s major philosophical metaphors . \\r\\nthe soldiers don\\'t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . \\r\\nunfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn\\'t want us to think these men are invincible . \\r\\nin fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work . \\r\\nalthough the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time . \\r\\nwhether they\\'re arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable . \\r\\nsure , there\\'s a zinger here and there , but war doesn\\'t change the fact boys will be boys . \\r\\nif and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them . \\r\\nthe final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence . \\r\\nprivate ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? \\r\\nthat\\'s not a premise for thrills , it\\'s symbolic of everything the film has worked for . \\r\\nit would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end . \\r\\ni remember reading a \" calvin & hobbes \" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , \" dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? \" \\r\\n \" saving private ryan \" is the adult version of that question . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\nfilm makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that\\'s why there\\'s no shortage of movies about this subject . \\r\\nthe best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . \\r\\nthese themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . \\r\\nhowever , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life . \\r\\nin his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : \" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we\\'re faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we\\'re completely unaware . \" \\r\\nwhile this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra\\'s it\\'s a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths . \\r\\nthe \" road not taken \" approach isn\\'t just a plot device , either . \\r\\nwriter/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train . \\r\\nthe audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . \\r\\nas her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals . \\r\\nthat woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit . \\r\\none day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day . \\r\\nthe scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform . \\r\\nin scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station . \\r\\non board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty . \\r\\nminutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . \\r\\nin scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging . \\r\\nshe doesn\\'t meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry\\'s infidelity . \\r\\njuxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there . \\r\\non one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience . \\r\\nbut , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill . \\r\\none of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less . \\r\\nit shouldn\\'t come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid . \\r\\npaltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout . \\r\\nshe plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man . \\r\\njohn hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable . \\r\\njohn lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland\\'s troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer . \\r\\nonly jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place . \\r\\nher attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it\\'s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element . \\r\\none member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . \\r\\ndouglas mcferran , who plays gerry\\'s best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he\\'s in . \\r\\npart of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie . \\r\\non one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy . \\r\\non another occasion , while laughing at gerry\\'s plight with the women in his life , he comments , \" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . \" \\r\\nbut it\\'s not all in the dialogue . \\r\\nmcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy . \\r\\nthis is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb . \\r\\nthe script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole . \\r\\nsliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however . \\r\\nfor those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\ntime will tell , but i\\'m sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . \\r\\nthis may sound like i didn\\'t like antz ; on the contrary , i\\'d put it up there with toy story . \\r\\nbut due to it\\'s pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn\\'t appear in disney\\'s version . \\r\\nsome of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film . \\r\\nsexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks\\' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . \\r\\nthe humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . \\r\\nthis is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . \\r\\nantz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen\\'s shtick and franz kafka\\'s metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . \\r\\nz ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . \\r\\n \" when you\\'re the middle child in a family of five million . . . \" he comments about his neglected childhood . \\r\\none night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . \\r\\nin walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . \\r\\nbala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . \\r\\nafter discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there\\'s a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . \\r\\nin order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . \\r\\nbut to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . \\r\\nhe and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . \\r\\nthe queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . \\r\\nmeanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . \\r\\nso z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . \\r\\nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . \\r\\nhowever , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . \\r\\nthe second half of the film revolves around z\\'s kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . \\r\\nthere , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . \\r\\nthe adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . \\r\\nlooming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i\\'m just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . \\r\\nthe ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . \\r\\nvisually , it\\'s an exciting rush of adrenaline . \\r\\nbut don\\'t be fooled . . . \\r\\nlittle kids shouldn\\'t see this , as they may just try and copy it . \\r\\nafter seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . \\r\\nhopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . \\r\\nas an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . \\r\\nvisually , it\\'s as stunning as what dreams may come . \\r\\nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren\\'t limited by gravity . \\r\\nthey can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . \\r\\none great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . \\r\\nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . \\r\\nhowever , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy\\'s shoe . \\r\\nit\\'s truly a great example of film making at its finest . \\r\\nwith computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants\\' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . \\r\\nthe best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . \\r\\nat one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . \\r\\ndo they ? ) . \\r\\nbarbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . \\r\\nyoung kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . \\r\\ndisney\\'s a bug\\'s life looks good , but i don\\'t know if they will be able to best dreamworks\\' newest animated feature in terms of animation . \\r\\nif not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . \\r\\nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . \\r\\nin fact , it far exceeds that one . \\r\\nwoody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he\\'s done in the past few years . \\r\\nwithout a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . \\r\\nin fact , i\\'m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . \\r\\nsharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . \\r\\nsylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . \\r\\nafter a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . \\r\\ngene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . \\r\\nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . \\r\\nanne bancroft has a minimal role , but she\\'s effective nonetheless . \\r\\ndanny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . \\r\\ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . \\r\\njennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won\\'t recognize her voice either . \\r\\nmany people will recognize grant shaud\\'s voice as the foreman . \\r\\nhe played miles on the tv show murphy brown . \\r\\nthis is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it\\'s grosses . \\r\\nof course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . \\r\\ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . \\r\\nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . \\r\\ntense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . \\r\\nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . \\r\\nkids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . \\r\\nmost of it will go over young children\\'s heads . \\r\\ndoes that mean you shouldn\\'t take kids to see it ?

considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal . \\r\\ni watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times . \\r\\nunder no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix . \\r\\nthis theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet . \\r\\nthe mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age . \\r\\nin other words , the sound sucked . \\r\\nas someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film . \\r\\ni'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together . \\r\\nthere , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review . \\r\\nwhich sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing . \\r\\nmy guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix .

darn good . \\r\\nthe matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked . \\r\\nkeanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax . \\r\\nit turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster . \\r\\nnow machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network . \\r\\nthe computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed . \\r\\nthe population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose . \\r\\nthat is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons . \\r\\nthey now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie . \\r\\nreeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \\r\\nnewcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters . \\r\\nthe action sequences are nothing short of spectacular . \\r\\nthis can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts . \\r\\nthis lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film . \\r\\nwhen you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful . \\r\\nas i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film . \\r\\nacting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either . \\r\\nkeanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances . \\r\\nalthough to his credit , it is one of his better performances . \\r\\nlaurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film . \\r\\nmore than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama . \\r\\njoe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had . \\r\\ncarrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role . \\r\\nit's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks . \\r\\nyou have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film . \\r\\nit was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences . \\r\\ni also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times . \\r\\nin more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird . \\r\\nit almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie . \\r\\nso they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about . \\r\\nthereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability . \\r\\nmy other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending . \\r\\nthe setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before . \\r\\nthe ending itself was just plain strange . \\r\\nthe main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch . \\r\\nwhile the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening . \\r\\n\"),\n",

d finale . \\r\\nthe script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn\\'t show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver . \\r\\napart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike . \\r\\nbut the content might be more than interesting for today\\'s viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival . \\r\\nuntil boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s . \\r\\nhardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists . \\r\\nthe view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn\\'t be too surprising . \\r\\nanyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema . \\r\\n'),\n",

a gothic city rather than a modern one . \\r\\nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \\r\\nthe most famous landmark to appear isn\\'t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it\\'s geno\\'s steaks . \\r\\nshadows and night scenes abound . \\r\\nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \\r\\nthis is the kind of setting where it\\'s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \\r\\nfallen\\'s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \\r\\nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \\r\\nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \\r\\nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \\r\\nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \\r\\nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \\r\\njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \\r\\nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \\r\\neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \\r\\nwashington\\'s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \\r\\nit\\'s not that he\\'s bad per se , but he\\'s not very interesting . \\r\\nthere\\'s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \\r\\nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \\r\\nwashington\\'s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \\r\\nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler\\'s list ) and donald sutherland . \\r\\nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren\\'t all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \\r\\nthat said , however , there\\'s nothing inspired about either davidtz\\'s or sutherland\\'s work . \\r\\nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \\r\\nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \\r\\nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \\r\\nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like \" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself \" become a little hard to swallow . \\r\\nin addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . \\r\\nhowever , despite the negatives , i\\'m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . \\r\\nthe final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . \\r\\nit\\'s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . \\r\\nat a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . \\r\\nthis is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it\\'s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . \\r\\nand , whatever you do , don\\'t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\ncasting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . \\r\\nschwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . \\r\\narnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . \\r\\nin other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . \\r\\nharrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they\\'ve all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . \\r\\nthere are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho\\'s character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine\\'s location by offering him his old life back . \\r\\nnone of these scenes really work , because arnie isn\\'t up to the task . \\r\\nthe filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . \\r\\nthis one isn\\'t at all believable the way arnold plays him . \\r\\nthe supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . \\r\\nas the prince of darkness , he\\'s suave and confident . \\r\\nhe acts like one would expect the devil to act . \\r\\nthe problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . \\r\\nbyrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . \\r\\nbyrne\\'s speech about the bible being \" overrated \" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold\\'s attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the \" \\'tis not ! \" \\r\\nvariety ) are feeble at best . \\r\\nthe only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . \\r\\nkevin pollack plays jericho\\'s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . \\r\\nrobin tunney isn\\'t given much to do except look scared . \\r\\nin fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . \\r\\nperformances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . \\r\\nthis being an action blockbuster , it\\'s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it\\'s utterly ridiculous . \\r\\nwhy is the devil coming on new year\\'s eve , 1999 ? \\r\\nbecause it\\'s exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn\\'t 666 , it turns out . \\r\\nsome nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you\\'ve got 1999 ! \\r\\nif you don\\'t buy this explanation , you\\'re not alone . \\r\\nit\\'s convoluted and silly at the same time . \\r\\nthe method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she\\'s christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . \\r\\n . \\r\\n . ) , and if that weren\\'t bad enough , there\\'s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn\\'t explained at all . \\r\\nwhy can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he\\'s powerless ? \\r\\nis he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? \\r\\nhow come he can\\'t control jericho or christine ? \\r\\nand how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? \\r\\na clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it\\'s never actually explained . \\r\\nusually , this sort of thing wouldn\\'t matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don\\'t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . \\r\\nthere are several predictable horror film clich ?

\\r\\nno , so why add this extra running time to the film ? \\r\\nthe answer : it looked cool . \\r\\nor how about the \" atmosphere \" ? \\r\\nthe beginning of the general\\'s daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music . \\r\\nnice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn\\'t matter , for when the film\\'s plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood . \\r\\nno attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . \\r\\ndid the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? \\r\\ninstead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside . \\r\\nthe above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie . \\r\\nas i\\'ve already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn\\'t jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . \\r\\nbrenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest \" yes , sir \" s i\\'ve ever heard . \\r\\nhe even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general\\'s daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . \\r\\nsunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . \\r\\nboth characters are protagonists , but it\\'s hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . \\r\\ni could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , \" let\\'s do it again , but this time , i want more . \" \\r\\ni say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . \\r\\nan even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general\\'s aide , colonel fowler . \\r\\ni swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . \\r\\na far cry from his days as linc in \" the mod squad \" , i can\\'t help but think he was acting from west\\'s direction . \\r\\na couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . \\r\\nthe only two actors who seem to have escaped west\\'s influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth\\'s mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . \\r\\nwoods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people\\'s minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . \\r\\nhutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn\\'t overacting . \\r\\ni haven\\'t read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i\\'ll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . \\r\\nthe movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . \\r\\nevery time we\\'re presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it\\'s the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . \\r\\ninstead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . \\r\\nthe army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . \\r\\nwould\\'ve been over in a half hour . \\r\\nthe film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . \\r\\nliterally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . \\r\\nthey both seem kind of happy . \\r\\nmaybe they were driving away from simon west . \\r\\n'),\n",

intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . \\r\\nwith their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you\\'ll not only enjoy , but also won\\'t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . \\r\\nthe film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers\\' last two films ) they almost all work . \\r\\ni have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . \\r\\none minute you\\'ll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you\\'ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary\\'s apartment . \\r\\none of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . \\r\\nhe is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he\\'s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . \\r\\nted\\'s a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don\\'t always work out . \\r\\nit\\'s comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . \\r\\nactually , i\\'ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . \\r\\nthe film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of

that show\\'s cancellation . \\r\\ncameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . \\r\\nhowever , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she\\'s got guys just falling over each other to be with her . \\r\\nheck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . \\r\\nmy girlfriend remarked that matt

elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . \\r\\nlin shae , who plays mary\\'s neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . \\r\\nlee evans , as mary\\'s friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . \\r\\nthe farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j

\\r\\nyeah , me too . ) \\r\\nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \\r\\ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \\r\\nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \\r\\ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \\r\\nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \\r\\nbut by the end of the film , they\\'re still doing the same schitck it hasn\\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\\'t been dropped either . \\r\\nthat\\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \\r\\n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \\r\\nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\\'s actions . \\r\\nthis doesn\\'t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\\'s condition early on , so they don\\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \\r\\nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \\r\\njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \\r\\nit\\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \\r\\ncarrey doesn\\'t pull any stunts we don\\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\\' script doesn\\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\\'t set up in any meaningful way . \\r\\nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \\r\\nzellweger\\'s irene is not a strong female lead mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \\r\\nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \\r\\nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \\r\\nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \\r\\nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \\r\\nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \\r\\nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \\r\\nbut i don\\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \\r\\nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\\'ll rebound just fine . \\r\\neven after that happens , though , i\\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \\r\\n'),\n",

one of the twentieth century\\'s greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see . \\r\\nhow much could you dress up the sets ? \\r\\nhow many models and computer effects could you use ? \\r\\nhow much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? \\r\\noh , if i\\'ve just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school . \\r\\nafter having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie . \\r\\nthere have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i\\'ve seen . \\r\\ntitanic tells its story in two time periods . \\r\\nit starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship . \\r\\nwhat they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news . \\r\\nthe woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas . \\r\\nthere she tells her story to lovett and his team . \\r\\nin 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society\\'s upper class , boards the titanic for the ship\\'s first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york . \\r\\nshe is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word . \\r\\non board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society\\'s expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic\\'s stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( \" steerage \" , as it\\'s referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping . \\r\\nalthough for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose\\'s social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal . \\r\\nthe story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through . \\r\\ndicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors . \\r\\nhis is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations . \\r\\ngirls are going to swoon over him . \\r\\nwinslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable . \\r\\nthe only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character\\'s upbringing . \\r\\nsimply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante . \\r\\nrather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting . \\r\\nbilly zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him . \\r\\nhis features are such that even when he smiles , there\\'s something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate . \\r\\nhe\\'s something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model . \\r\\nlike dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well . \\r\\nbacking up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal\\'s personal assistant ( or \" man \" as they said at the turn of the century ) . \\r\\nno matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match . \\r\\nadditionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as \" the unsinkable \" molly brown , danny nucci as jack\\'s friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie . \\r\\nnice to see dr . bombay getting work . \\r\\nalso scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die . \\r\\nthis by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship\\'s crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else . \\r\\nin this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures . \\r\\nyou don\\'t just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well . \\r\\nas i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects . \\r\\nthe interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic . \\r\\nwith regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale . \\r\\ncameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet . \\r\\ncould\\'ve fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless . \\r\\nalso of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning . \\r\\nwe are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner . \\r\\nthese technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion . \\r\\nin all , james cameron\\'s titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action . \\r\\nthe fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer\\'s attention is held

the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . \\r\\nwill\\'s reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters\\' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it . \\r\\nfor a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . \\r\\nthis film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . \\r\\n \" good will hunting \" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . \\r\\nand in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . \\r\\nwill\\'s relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the \\'f\\' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will\\'s character . \\r\\nadd all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven\\'t given this film four stars . \\r\\nwell , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . \\r\\nthere are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . \\r\\nstill , \" good will hunting \" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of \\'97 films . \\r\\n'),\n",

       " Pandas(Index=224, label='pos', review='the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola\\'s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \\r\\nmartin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \\r\\nunfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola\\'s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . \\r\\nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \\r\\nthis film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \\r\\ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \\r\\nthe book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \\r\\nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \\r\\nafter couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \\r\\nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \\r\\nwealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \\r\\nbut the perfect world of \" wiseguys \" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy\\'s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy\\'s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry\\'s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \\r\\ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \\r\\nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \\r\\nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \\r\\nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \\r\\nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \\r\\nscorsese also manages to break viewer\\'s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \\r\\nwith the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character\\'s dialogue or narrator\\'s commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \\r\\neven if we don\\'t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \\r\\nfirst , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie\\'s ironic prologue . \\r\\nthen , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \\r\\nthis multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \\r\\nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \\r\\nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \\r\\nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \\r\\nhowever , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \\r\\nsuch scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \\r\\nfragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn\\'t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \\r\\nhe uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious \" a day in life \" segment near the end of the film . \\r\\nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \\r\\nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \\r\\njoe pesci deserved his \" oscar \" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \\r\\nray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn\\'t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \\r\\nliotta\\'s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \\r\\nliotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \\r\\nlorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \\r\\npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \\r\\nas a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . \\r\\nbecause of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . \\r\\n'),\n",

furthermore , most of the acting is quite good . \\r\\nbut i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved . \\r\\ni can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it\\'s pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams . \\r\\nthings start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) . \\r\\ncaulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous . \\r\\nthe subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years . \\r\\npowell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it\\'s now caulder\\'s job to find out of he\\'s mentally competent enough to stand trial . \\r\\nthrough a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell . \\r\\neven though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting . \\r\\nas i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he\\'s on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he\\'s not acting , that he\\'s actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . \\r\\nthe character himself isn\\'t very interesting -- he\\'s just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . \\r\\ngooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual . \\r\\nthe screenplay , written by gerald di pego and \" suggested by \" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he\\'s obsessed with his work ) . \\r\\nnonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . \\r\\nunfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . \\r\\nturtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct\\'s artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots . \\r\\nfirst , we have the prison warden subplot . \\r\\nthe prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder\\'s progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that\\'s fine . \\r\\nthere\\'s also the prison guard subplot . \\r\\nthe prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he\\'s instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . \\r\\nthen there\\'s the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man . \\r\\nif some of this stuff sounds familiar , that\\'s because they\\'re all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films . \\r\\nthe evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here . \\r\\nthe offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo\\'s nest had . \\r\\nashton\\'s evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown\\'s in the shawshank redemption . \\r\\nhopkins\\' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs . \\r\\nand then there\\'s the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film . \\r\\nperhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . \\r\\nthe message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are \" takers , \" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . \\r\\ni can sympathize with that , but only when it\\'s in a compelling film . \\r\\nthis is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards . \\r\\nwhat does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? \\r\\nif all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . \\r\\nif the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn\\'t rely on the strength of its actors . \\r\\n'),\n",

his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . \\r\\nhe is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . \\r\\nthere is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . \\r\\nit shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap . \\r\\nas they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . \\r\\nit\\'s a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie\\'s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . \\r\\nafter all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . \\r\\nthe best scenes in \" the horse whisperer \" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . \\r\\nalthough booker\\'s horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . \\r\\nthese are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . \\r\\nat some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . \\r\\nnevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . \\r\\nthere are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . \\r\\nalthough the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make \" the horse whisperer \" worth the price of admission . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\nhowever , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden\\'s camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . \\r\\nin retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . \\r\\nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau\\'s new york office at one federal plaza . \\r\\nwhile investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . \\r\\ngenerally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . \\r\\neven spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . \\r\\nhubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . \\r\\nthe original tagline for patriot games was , \" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . \" \\r\\nhowever true , it was pulled before the movie\\'s release because it sounded too much like a dare . \\r\\nrevisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself ,

excessive ( who\\'s going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . \\r\\ni liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . \\r\\nit provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . \\r\\nin fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . \\r\\nalthough it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups . \\r\\nthroughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . \\r\\nwhat results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . \\r\\nit actually gets rather heady at times , but it\\'s a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don\\'t underestimate the intelligence of the audience . \\r\\ni don\\'t know if it\\'s his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . \\r\\nthis , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . \\r\\nannette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i\\'ve seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . \\r\\nit\\'s somewhat unfortunate that her character\\'s fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . \\r\\nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . \\r\\nhowever , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film\\'s development . \\r\\nnotable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . \\r\\nthe role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . \\r\\ndifficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . \\r\\nperhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom \" wings , \" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . \\r\\nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick\\'s favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . \\r\\ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner\\'s record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most . \\r\\nrevell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . \\r\\nit\\'s nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we\\'ve been getting throughout the year . \\r\\nmissteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . \\r\\nfor example , it\\'s pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . \\r\\nunfortunately , there\\'s a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching . \\r\\nin the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops . \\r\\nverisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . \\r\\nthe film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . \\r\\na noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . \\r\\nthese flaws are glaring , but they don\\'t detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class . \\r\\n'),\n",

movie . \\r\\nthen they have to get the toys . \\r\\noh , the video came out ? \\r\\ngot to buy it , or risk little billy\\'s temper tantrums for the next month . \\r\\nall of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom . \\r\\nstay at the disneyland hotel ! \\r\\nbuy a disney t-shirt ! \\r\\neat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! \\r\\nit\\'s both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it . \\r\\ndale carnegie should have had it so good . \\r\\nwhat\\'s most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality . \\r\\nyou see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot . \\r\\nthe theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not . \\r\\nthe plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same . \\r\\nhowever , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer . \\r\\nluckily , disney\\'s latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula . \\r\\nthe film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) . \\r\\nsoon , china\\'s emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china\\'s defense . \\r\\nwhen the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household . \\r\\nfearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army . \\r\\nmulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling . \\r\\nmulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman\\'s role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that \" grace \" is not one of her strong points . \\r\\nvery early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one\\'s family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task . \\r\\nby leaving home to fight in her father\\'s place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too . \\r\\nas is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film . \\r\\ni\\'m not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time . \\r\\nboth lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan\\'s army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga\\'s voice translates much better to animation . \\r\\nyou have to hear it to understand . \\r\\ninterestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan . \\r\\nthere is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie . \\r\\nit is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney\\'s own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . \\r\\nartistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically \" disneyfied \" ethnic tale . \\r\\nthere are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu\\'s hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . \\r\\nthe other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . \\r\\nwhen mulan resolves to take her father\\'s place , she dons her father\\'s old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword . \\r\\nas she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal . \\r\\nit just left me thinking , \" that was really cool . \" \\r\\na wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang\\'s conscripted army . \\r\\neven more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan . \\r\\nalthough an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance . \\r\\ni found the choice of b . d . \\r\\nwong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short\\'s wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything\\'s possible . \\r\\nin any event , wong performs admirably as well . \\r\\none character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa . \\r\\nshe deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people . \\r\\njune foray , who supplies grandmother fa\\'s speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) . \\r\\nmarni nixon , who provides grandmother fa\\'s singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady . \\r\\nwith this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history . \\r\\nmulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films . \\r\\nin an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a \" miss saigon \" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles . \\r\\nin addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei . \\r\\ni guess clyde kusatsu wasn\\'t available . \\r\\nat a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults . \\r\\nthis is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better . \\r\\n'),\n",

       " Pandas(Index=276, label='pos', review='alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters . \\r\\ni saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn\\'t like it . \\r\\nof course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault . \\r\\nin order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor . \\r\\njames cameron\\'s aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series . \\r\\ni am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality . \\r\\nmany thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action . \\r\\nboth are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written . \\r\\nas for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion . \\r\\nperhaps watching alien 3 on video helped . \\r\\non the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn\\'t see . \\r\\nit was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh . \\r\\ni had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities . \\r\\ndon\\'t get me wrong--i\\'m not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting . \\r\\nhowever , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters . \\r\\nas a result , alien 3\\'s only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters . \\r\\nwe never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie . \\r\\nthere were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt . ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films . \\r\\nthe other character was dr . clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs . \\r\\nalien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off . \\r\\nthe prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry . \\r\\nwithout using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film . \\r\\nan impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card . \\r\\nwe see lt . ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments . . . \\r\\n ( title ) . . . \\r\\na shot of an alien egg . . . \\r\\n ( title ) . . . \\r\\nalien legs stretch up into the air . . . \\r\\n ( title ) . . . \\r\\nand so on and so on . \\r\\nduring these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed . \\r\\nit\\'s quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time . \\r\\nbecause of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison . \\r\\nhowever , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod . \\r\\nunfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed . \\r\\nripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery . \\r\\nof course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates . \\r\\nripley is revived and asks to see the ship . \\r\\nafter seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated . \\r\\nthis cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films . \\r\\nfeaturing a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog\\'s demise . \\r\\nit\\'s one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog . \\r\\nand this is where alien 3 succeeds . \\r\\nfincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) . \\r\\nfincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films . \\r\\nalien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images . \\r\\nby doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise . \\r\\nmany people have criticized fincher\\'s filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal . \\r\\nshowing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived . \\r\\ni feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron . \\r\\nhowever , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn\\'t want to see die ) . \\r\\nwhy she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don\\'t plan on spoiling that in this review . \\r\\n>from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever . \\r\\nin alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane\\'s stomach . \\r\\nin aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine . \\r\\nalien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley . \\r\\nripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her . \\r\\nwhy it doesn\\'t kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending . \\r\\nfincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors\\' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors\\' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces . \\r\\nmany critics didn\\'t like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot . \\r\\nmost of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher\\'s turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that\\'s not always a bad thing . \\r\\nthe plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists . \\r\\nagain , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off . \\r\\nhowever , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron\\'s film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison . \\r\\nas a result , no weapons are to be found . \\r\\nthis creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense . \\r\\nas an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not . \\r\\nthe unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters . \\r\\ni never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about . \\r\\ndespite this , ripley was the central figure , and that\\'s what is important . \\r\\nwe care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys . \\r\\nagain , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions . \\r\\nwhile cameron\\'s version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets . \\r\\nthe cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie . \\r\\nthe confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around . \\r\\nthe yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense . \\r\\nshadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien . \\r\\nthe alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense . \\r\\nthe camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters . \\r\\nthe sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien . \\r\\nthe narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed . \\r\\nthe sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future . \\r\\none of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there ) . \\r\\nsigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens . \\r\\nshe was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb . \\r\\nher reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter . \\r\\nit\\'s quite touching really . \\r\\ncharles s . dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him . \\r\\ncharles dance turns in a nice low-key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately . \\r\\nlance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii , but he was more entertaining in aliens . \\r\\nthe rest of the cast is pretty stale , though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world . \\r\\nalien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language , and sex . \\r\\nalthough it has its flaws , alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism . \\r\\nthis film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie . \\r\\nwhile kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films , fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out . \\r\\nit\\'s a film like fincher\\'s which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) . \\r\\nin fact , it tells us that we , as a society , have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little \" fake . \" \\r\\nwhenever something looks

\\r\\nfrancis ford coppola . \\r\\nthe book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather . \\r\\nthe rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . \\r\\nby bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness . \\r\\nbut the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material . \\r\\ncan you get any more questionable than john grisham ? \\r\\ndepends on whom you ask . \\r\\nbut there's no question that grisham's work grabs people . \\r\\nlike puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam . \\r\\nso something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers . \\r\\nthe result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . \\r\\n>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . \\r\\nthis terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . \\r\\nwitness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . \\r\\nwe roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . \\r\\nright away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . \\r\\npay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman . \\r\\nthis is what a great director can do for questionable source material . \\r\\nthe sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . \\r\\nmagruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . \\r\\noutside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . \\r\\ndriven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . \\r\\nthere he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for . \\r\\nher car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . \\r\\nmagruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . \\r\\nthis simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . \\r\\nhe succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . \\r\\nbut then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . \\r\\nthe cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney . \\r\\nhis only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . \\r\\nif this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . \\r\\naltman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together . \\r\\nan accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . \\r\\nis his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? \\r\\nmagruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late . \\r\\nas the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . \\r\\nand life is never so bad that it can't get worse . \\r\\nif you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques . \\r\\ncharacters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . \\r\\ncrucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . \\r\\ndialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . \\r\\nand of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . \\r\\nthanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . \\r\\nand now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . \\r\\nthe naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . \\r\\nis it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ? \\r\\nyou be the judge . \\r\\nbut back to the picture at hand . \\r\\nin the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured . \\r\\nin the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . \\r\\nwhat may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . \\r\\nbut there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . \\r\\nthat polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . \\r\\nthey probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . \\r\\nand that , my friends , should make you very afraid . \\r\\n\"),\n",

\\r\\ni thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn\\'t have been anything to talk about in the first place . \\r\\nto be sure , \" gloria \" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy\\'s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . \\r\\nright before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . \\r\\neventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . \\r\\nmeanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn\\'t commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . \\r\\nwhen he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . \\r\\ngloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don\\'t they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . \\r\\nthe previous incarnation of \" gloria \" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can\\'t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . \\r\\nthere is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn\\'t completely unbearable to watch . \\r\\ni liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . \\r\\nthese bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers . \\r\\nthroughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , \" who really cares ? \" \\r\\nas gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn\\'t sound realistic at all . \\r\\nin the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone\\'s performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . \\r\\nalthough not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . \\r\\njean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . \\r\\nall other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria\\'s friend whom she turns to for help . \\r\\nsony , the studio that released \" gloria , \" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don\\'t blame them . \\r\\nthey declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved . \\r\\nalthough how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular \" in dreams , \" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion \" gloria \" is going to vanish from theaters faster than \" ishtar , \" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . \\r\\nalthough stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995\\'s \" casino \" or 1996\\'s \" last dance \" if you don\\'t believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of \" gloria \" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\nchicken pies , of course . \\r\\nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \\r\\nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \\r\\npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park\\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \\r\\n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \\r\\nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \\r\\nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \\r\\nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \\r\\nthing is , the film doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \\r\\npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \\r\\npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \\r\\nbut they\\'re * chickens * , so it\\'s funny to us . \\r\\nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park\\'s films ) succeed is the animators\\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\\'re cribbing . \\r\\nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \\r\\nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \\r\\nthere\\'s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\\'s nationality and film history . \\r\\nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \\r\\nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \\r\\nconsider this : since july of last year , i\\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \\r\\nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \\r\\nwhy ? \\r\\nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they\\'re parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch\\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \\r\\nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \\r\\nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn\\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \\r\\nif you\\'ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \\r\\neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \\r\\npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\\'s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \\r\\nenjoyment of this movie doesn\\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\\'ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \\r\\nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \\r\\nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \\r\\nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \\r\\nthe characters\\' inevitable romance doesn\\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \\r\\npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\\'t any help . \\r\\njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \\r\\nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \\r\\none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \\r\\nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \\r\\nthe animation is first-rate . \\r\\nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \\r\\nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \\r\\nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug\\'s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \\r\\ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\\'ll catch all the details . \\r\\nanyway , the movie\\'s just a boatload of fun . \\r\\nfunnest damn movie i\\'ve seen all year . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\ni don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . \\r\\nknock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here . \\r\\nfor instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . \\r\\nwhy ? \\r\\nwho knows . \\r\\nwhat are the implications of this ? \\r\\ni have no idea . \\r\\nmost action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . \\r\\nknock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . \\r\\nthe acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . \\r\\nsorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . \\r\\nvan damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . \\r\\nthe only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . \\r\\ntsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . \\r\\nthey're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . \\r\\nbut his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed . \\r\\nlots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character . \\r\\nbut did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? \\r\\ni hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought . \\r\\nknock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania . \\r\\nif it were boring , i'd give it zero stars . \\r\\nbut it's not boring : it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent . \\r\\nit's also funny , even when it isn't meaning to be funny . \\r\\na bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted . \\r\\ni recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i can't deny it's zany , useless charm . \\r\\noh , i know , they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . \\r\\nit's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful . \\r\\n\"),\n",

\\r\\nthe most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . \\r\\nthus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul\\'s father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . \\r\\nthe end result is a distinct chill : we can\\'t warm to most of the cast and we don\\'t care much for them . \\r\\nand it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . \\r\\ndune is also a very serous film . \\r\\nthe constant \" self-talk \" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . \\r\\nthe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . \\r\\nhumour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen\\'s mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . \\r\\nyou may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus\\' star wars trilogy . \\r\\nthe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . \\r\\nit still possesses enough of lynch\\'s stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . \\r\\nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldi\\'s giant sandworms are an awesome sight . \\r\\nboth the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . \\r\\nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . \\r\\nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis\\' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . \\r\\nsee it in the widescreen format if you can . \\r\\nand despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . \\r\\nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who\\'s secret aim is to manipulate paul\\'s destiny for its own shadowy ends . \\r\\nas paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . \\r\\nthe conclusion ? \\r\\nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert\\'s original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . \\r\\ndavid lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . \\r\\ndune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . \\r\\nmany chose to stay away altogether , as the film\\'s disastrous box office showing attests . \\r\\nthe extended version , however , is a rather different beast . \\r\\nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition \" director\\'s cut \" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . \\r\\nbut , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \\r\\nin a way , then , it is partly lynch\\'s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \\r\\nstung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director\\'s guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with \" allen smithee \" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \\r\\nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous \" judas booth \" . \\r\\ncertainly , looking at the results of mca\\'s handiwork there\\'s at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \\r\\nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \\r\\nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version\\'s storyline . \\r\\npaul\\'s relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \\r\\nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \\r\\npaul\\'s initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \\r\\nand as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \\r\\nas a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv\\'s version of dune is clearly superior . \\r\\nas a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \\r\\nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \\r\\nthere\\'s some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \\r\\nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \\r\\nships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \\r\\nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \\r\\nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \\r\\nbut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn\\'t even in herbert\\'s book . \\r\\nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his \" heart plug \" . \\r\\nits a surreal and disturbing episode that\\'s very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \\r\\ndespite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \\r\\nall up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \\r\\nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the \" alan smithee \" version remains the closest we\\'ll get to what the movie should have been . \\r\\non repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \\r\\nstill , as one of this century\\'s great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \\r\\nwith rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \\r\\n'),\n",

! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . \\r\\nand obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he\\'s nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn\\'s batman . \\r\\nhowever , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . \\r\\nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness\\' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . \\r\\nin fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that\\'s one of the problems with this film . \\r\\ni would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i\\'ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . \\r\\nhowever , if you are the one person in america who * hasn\\'t * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn\\'t bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . \\r\\nfor example , one of the film\\'s main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . \\r\\nfor those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader\\'s master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back . \" \\r\\nso , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . \\r\\na lot of the movie is like that . \\r\\nr2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it\\'s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience\\'s pre-existing fondness for them . . . \\r\\nbecause he doesn\\'t do much to add to it in any way . \\r\\nsame goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn\\'t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . \\r\\neven * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia\\'s home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . \\r\\nwhat\\'s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? \\r\\nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \\r\\nthere\\'s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \\r\\nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \\r\\ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \\r\\nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \\r\\nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you\\'ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" \\r\\nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \\r\\noddly , this isn\\'t just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \\r\\nwell , he\\'s done a good job . \\r\\nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \\r\\nthat\\'s not jake lloyd\\'s fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \\r\\nthat\\'s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \\r\\nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \\r\\nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin\\'s future evil in the film . \\r\\nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there\\'s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \\r\\nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \\r\\nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn\\'t all hearts and roses is yoda\\'s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \\r\\nhis explanation ?

\\r\\nis it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who\\'s in everything for the money ? \\r\\nor is it a combination of both ? \\r\\n \" the jackal \" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . \\r\\nthe connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . \\r\\nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . \\r\\nthe supporting characters are worse . \\r\\nsidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . \\r\\nwhat is poitier doing here ? \\r\\nhe\\'s one of the best living actors ! \\r\\ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? \\r\\ndiane venora\\'s russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . \\r\\nit\\'s not that anyone\\'s bad here ; it\\'s that they have nothing to do . \\r\\nthe plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . \\r\\nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . \\r\\nthere are several times where he\\'s in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . \\r\\ntake a scene where he\\'s being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . \\r\\ndoesn\\'t killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? \\r\\nand does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? \\r\\ngeez ! \\r\\nis there anything good here ? \\r\\nwell . . . a \\r\\ncouple things . \\r\\ni did like willis\\'s icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . \\r\\nrichard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . \\r\\nand a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . \\r\\nbut none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they\\'re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is \" the jackal . \" \\r\\ndirector michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior \" rob roy \" ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way . \\r\\nevery now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( \" clear and present danger , \" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but \" the jackal \" is an example of when they go completely wrong . \\r\\n'),\n",

he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn\\'t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . \\r\\njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . \\r\\nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of \" deliverance , \" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . \\r\\nhe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( \" 2001 \" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in \" zardoz \" besides the inadvertent humor . \\r\\nsean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . \\r\\nhe got exactly that in \" zardoz , \" and it\\'s a wonder it didn\\'t end his career . \\r\\ni\\'m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . \\r\\nis it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? \\r\\nis it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? \\r\\nor is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? \\r\\nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . \\r\\ncome to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . \\r\\npeople high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\n \" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . \\r\\nwe\\'ve already had a fish and a crab , and we\\'ve had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have \\r\\nwe had an ape and an elephant yet ?

\\r\\n \" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? \" \\r\\nwell , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . \\r\\nbut hey , tarzan\\'s a young adult . \\r\\ndo you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? \\r\\nisn\\'t that illegal in most countries ? \\r\\noh , well . \\r\\ni don\\'t think disney will be using my quote anymore . \\r\\ntarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . \\r\\nthere\\'s lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . \\r\\nwe instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . \\r\\nthis isn\\'t really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it\\'s just different . \\r\\ndo yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . \\r\\nwith each new feature , disney animation gets even better . \\r\\nnot necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . \\r\\nthere are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . \\r\\nthe way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn\\'t just tarzan , it\\'s \" extreme tarzan . \" \\r\\nhowever , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its \" chandelier scene , \" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . \\r\\nlasting but a few seconds at most , it\\'s been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . \\r\\nas usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . \\r\\nthe one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o\\'donnell . \\r\\ngoing into the film , i didn\\'t know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . \\r\\nher performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , \" that\\'s no boy ape , that rosie o\\'donnell . \" \\r\\ndistracting to say the least . \\r\\ni\\'ll admit i\\'ve never read the edgar rice burroughs story \" tarzan of the apes , \" so i couldn\\'t tell you how true this film stays to the book . \\r\\nbut unless you\\'re a purist , you should have few objections to this film . \\r\\nwith solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . \\r\\nnote : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . \\r\\nthis time , i\\'ll just say that i went to mcdonald\\'s yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . \\r\\n\\'nuff said . \\r\\n'),\n",

, \" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman\\'s oeuvre will find few surprises . \\r\\nmuch of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion . \\r\\nlou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments . \\r\\nis he part of a wider conspiracy ? \\r\\nwith an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them . \\r\\nthe result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls\\' interaction , hank\\'s investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape . \\r\\nif \" brokedown palace \" has a major flaw , it is its creators\\' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story\\'s main avenue . \\r\\nand , if that were all there was to \" brokedown palace , \" it wouldn\\'t be a very good movie . \\r\\nbut i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded . \\r\\nfor the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations . \\r\\nultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing . \\r\\nyoung and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure . \\r\\npresented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) . \\r\\nclear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend . \\r\\nshe comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) . \\r\\nwhereas darlene\\'s life is \" on-track , \" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and \" fulfillment , \" alice\\'s is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning . \\r\\none poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo . \\r\\ntellingly , alice is present but not included . \\r\\njust as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice\\'s face doesn\\'t read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while \" dar \" remains seated in the shade . \\r\\n \" brokedown palace \" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank . \\r\\nhowever unintentional , it\\'s all alice\\'s fault . \\r\\nshe\\'s responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick . \\r\\n ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film\\'s beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . ) \\r\\ndar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence . \\r\\nnever mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate . \\r\\ndar is innocent . \\r\\nit doesn\\'t matter . \\r\\nalice is the subject of this movie . \\r\\nshe and her journey toward personal freedom . \\r\\nalong the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals . \\r\\nin the end , that culture , like its representatives , \" yankee \" hank and dar\\'s father ( a \" man who knows how to grease the wheels \" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl\\'s tragedy . \\r\\nthailand\\'s culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison . \\r\\nit amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes . \\r\\ni believe the filmmaker\\'s view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior . \\r\\nthe thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles . \\r\\nthe girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born . \\r\\ntheir prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit . \\r\\nthe prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and \" hard manual labor \" consisted of picking grass ! \\r\\nthe thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic . \\r\\nas for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film\\'s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality . \\r\\n\\'freedom\\' has many faces and \" brokedown palace \" explores many of them . \\r\\nin the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit . \\r\\nsome settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter . \\r\\nbut freedom seldom comes without a price . \\r\\nwhich is why the movie\\'s other tag lines are : \" what is your dream ? \" \\r\\nand \" how far would you go ? \" \\r\\ni believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film\\'s end is alice . \\r\\nshe finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility . \\r\\ni think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact . \\r\\nkate beckinsale\\'s character might more properly be likened to the \" released \" temple bird referred to twice during the film , \" trained to fly back to its cage . \" \\r\\nas the thai magistrate observed in the film\\'s climactic scene , the issue was always one of \" character ; \" and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that \" freedom \" is achieved within oneself . \\r\\nif one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ? \\r\\nincreasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of \\'kung fu woman\\'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures . \\r\\nhere , at last , is the story of a modern heroine . \\r\\nin reading the many user\\'s comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors . \\r\\nthink about that . \\r\\nwhen was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ?

\\r\\nmaybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him . \\r\\nit\\'s pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom . \\r\\nplease read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest . \\r\\nin 1986 i remember watching a movie called \" wisdom \" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do . \\r\\nwhat i like to call \" guess what , it was all a dream \" scenario . \\r\\nin \" wisdom \" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters \" wake up \" from an apparent and say \" gosh , i\\'m glad that didn\\'t really happen ! \" . \\r\\ni considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with . \\r\\nwell , the same thing happens in \" the devils advocate \" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn\\'t happen . \\r\\ni know it\\'s a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that . \\r\\nof course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one . \\r\\nas i recall , \" wisdom \" was a decent film . \\r\\n \" the devil\\'s advocate \" is not . \\r\\nthe devils advocate \\r\\ndirected by taylor hackford john milton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . al pacino kevin lomax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . keanu \\r\\nreeves mary ann lomax . . . . . . . . . . . charlize \\r\\ntheron mrs . lomax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . judith \\r\\nivey eddie barzoon . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jeffrey jones christabella . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . connie \\r\\nnielson \\r\\nwritten by randy turgeon , march 18 , 1998 . \\r\\n'),\n",
       " Pandas(Index=381, label='neg', review='i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . \\r\\nit\\'s not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . \\r\\ni sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . \\r\\nin a word , it\\'s the same thing that\\'s wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . \\r\\nmore to the point , it\\'s the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you\\'re telling a story about a relationship . \\r\\nthe bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we\\'re expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they\\'re attractive and pleasant . \\r\\nin this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o\\'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage . \\r\\nit\\'s a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years . \\r\\nconvinced despite his reservations that it\\'s time to \" sh * t or get off the pot , \" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . \\r\\nanne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will . \\r\\njimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p . m . on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child . \\r\\nthere are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy\\'s 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends . \\r\\nit\\'s a wacky , brewster\\'s millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film\\'s better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . \\r\\nat least that would be the case if jimmy weren\\'t already a world-class altruist . \\r\\nscreenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn\\'t get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs . \\r\\nfrom the outset , jimmy\\'s motivation isn\\'t cash ; it\\'s the livelihoods of his devoted employees . \\r\\nit\\'s almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor\\'s plot development . \\r\\nby any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . \\r\\nand that\\'s the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . \\r\\nthere\\'s never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there\\'s no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . \\r\\nthe blandly nice o\\'donnell couldn\\'t pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the filmmakers don\\'t even let him ; zellweger\\'s anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to , but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged . \\r\\nand forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . \\r\\nthe parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they\\'re all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . \\r\\ni\\'ll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov\\'s rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . \\r\\nfar more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . \\r\\nyou\\'re never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that\\'s not the real problem . \\r\\nnor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it\\'s leading up to . \\r\\nthe problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there\\'s no spark , no energy , no humanity . \\r\\nit\\'s an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer\\'s digestions . \\r\\nwe\\'ve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don\\'t even have a pulse . \\r\\nthe bachelor is love among the mannequins . \\r\\n'),\n",

       " Pandas(Index=383, label='pos', review=\"jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation . \\r\\non the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice . \\r\\non the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events . \\r\\nthis choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow . \\r\\nindeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled . \\r\\n_beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war . \\r\\nfor newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil . \\r\\noprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end . \\r\\nwhat she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished . \\r\\n_beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin . \\r\\nthe film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse . \\r\\ninvisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards . \\r\\nsethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves . \\r\\ndemme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects . \\r\\nall of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real . \\r\\nwhen paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror . \\r\\ninstead , he asks who the ghost is . \\r\\nas in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created . \\r\\nsethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears . \\r\\nin fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay . \\r\\nthe story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump . \\r\\nsethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health . \\r\\nthey know not who she is , but that doesn't matter . \\r\\nonly paul d is suspicious of the stranger . \\r\\nlittle does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years . \\r\\nwinfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset . \\r\\nshe inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show . \\r\\nlisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later . \\r\\ndanny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter . \\r\\nas sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears . \\r\\nthe film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself . \\r\\nthandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end . \\r\\ndeparting from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel . \\r\\ntotemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit . \\r\\n_beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do . \\r\\nfor the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality . \\r\\nthis , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book . \\r\\nthough the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film . \\r\\nnothing is spoon-fed to the viewer . \\r\\nmorrison's novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb . \\r\\nthe movie begins like _poltergeist_ , and ends like _the color purple_ , with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle . \\r\\ntaken as a whole , beloved is a disquieting , one-of-a-kind experience , one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance . \\r\\n\"),\n",

the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . \\r\\nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . \\r\\nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . \\r\\nsam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . \\r\\non the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . \\r\\nshepard\\'s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . \\r\\nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . \\r\\nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . \\r\\nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots\\' wives . \\r\\nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . \\r\\ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman\\'s superb direction . \\r\\nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . \\r\\nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . \\r\\neverything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . \\r\\nin that setting , it\\'s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . \\r\\nbut the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and \" natural \" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . \\r\\ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . \\r\\nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , \" mercury \" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . \\r\\nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman\\'s superb use of poetic movie language . \\r\\nediting is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . \\r\\nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . \\r\\nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . \\r\\nanother fine contribution of this film is \" oscar \" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . \\r\\nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . \\r\\nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . \\r\\nthis film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . \\r\\nsome of the \" mercury \" astronauts aren\\'t fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . \\r\\nfilm also lacks proper closure . \\r\\non the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . \\r\\nalso , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan\\'s america . \\r\\nin some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . \\r\\ntime has passed ; now we don\\'t see astronauts as heroes . \\r\\nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . \\r\\nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . \\r\\nbut this film , sentimental reminder of the times \" when future began \" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow \" mercury \" astronauts\\' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . \\r\\nand even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema . \\r\\n'),\n",

marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don\\'t have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren\\'t really even sure if they can trust one another . \\r\\n \" the faculty \" is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original \" scream , \" and rodriguez , whose \" from dusk till dawn \" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90\\'s . \\r\\nwilliamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer . \\r\\nthe plotline of \" the faculty , \" involving aliens taking over other people\\'s bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from \" invasion of the body snatchers , \" to \" the puppet masters , \" to \" invaders from mars , \" so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful . \\r\\nsurely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren\\'t . \\r\\nthe epilogue was also a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better . \\r\\nthe performances in \" the faculty \" were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do . \\r\\none exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well-known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster . \\r\\nas members of the faculty , robert patrick ( \" t2 : judgement day \" ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role . \\r\\nthe standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell . \\r\\nif there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence . \\r\\nsince the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the \" queen \" alien , many of the faculty members disappear . \\r\\nit might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget . \\r\\nalthough not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , \" the faculty \" is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . \\r\\nwhile the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren\\'t human . \\r\\nand by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . \\r\\n+ note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . \\r\\nin actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan\\'s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . \\r\\nif i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving . \\r\\n'),\n",

not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! \\r\\nin our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it \" all \" . \\r\\nand seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it \" all \" the easy way . \\r\\nhe\\'s a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him . \\r\\nben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko . \\r\\nhis job is to influence trainee\\'s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood . \\r\\nit\\'s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they\\'re told to dish out to prospective buyers . \\r\\naffleck\\'s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin\\'s similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor\\'s performance . \\r\\naffleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge . \\r\\nwhen alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own . \\r\\nby comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading . \\r\\nthe brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game . \\r\\nrap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters . \\r\\nthey aren\\'t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes . \\r\\nwe drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be . \\r\\nas in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness . \\r\\ni know this story . \\r\\nwe all do . \\r\\nbut it can work if it\\'s told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \\\\ director ben younger tells it . \\r\\nas a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn . \\r\\nhis style is sitcom bland . \\r\\nbut his writing isn\\'t . \\r\\nyounger\\'s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ;

the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys . \\r\\nthose ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth\\'s friend and his mentor . \\r\\ndiesl shines in his minor role . \\r\\nthis week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner . \\r\\nin that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80\\'s , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70\\'s . \\r\\nnicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can\\'t have . \\r\\nnia long , as the firm\\'s secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi\\'s love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting . \\r\\nthe two make an oddly likeable couple . \\r\\nlong is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof . \\r\\nat one point he says to her \" i\\'m just lookin\\' for some chocolate love \" . \\r\\nit\\'s a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way , it becomes sweetly endearing . \\r\\nunfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy . \\r\\nthere is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares . \\r\\nthis is okay when taken in small doses , but younger\\'s conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo moments , one following the other . \\r\\na particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth\\'s manipulations have on one of his poor victims . \\r\\nit\\'s not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message . \\r\\nthat message being , \" greed is bad \" . \\r\\nyes it\\'s patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven\\'t seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur . \\r\\nand all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners . \\r\\nboiler room offers neither extreme . \\r\\nit gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\nwow ! \\r\\nmike myers\\' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr . evil\\'s , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers\\' frozen body . \\r\\naustin powers learns of dr . evil\\'s trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it . \\r\\nonce arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his \" pad \" , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr . evil . \\r\\nas the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr . evil , for example , \" don\\'t go there , girlfriend ! \" \\r\\nto the president of the united states . \\r\\nmany witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they\\'re funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes . \\r\\ntake for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is . \\r\\nthe way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing . \\r\\nthere was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn\\'t laughing . \\r\\nthe last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers ! \\r\\nit is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it . \\r\\nthe film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , \" it\\'s funny how england and southern california look nothing alike . \" \\r\\ntswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england . \\r\\ni can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters . \\r\\ni believe that dr . evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did . \\r\\ndr . evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film . \\r\\ni felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard . \\r\\nalso making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer . \\r\\neven though the midget actor is 30 years old , he is adorable by dr . evil\\'s side constantly . \\r\\nthe first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality , such as lack of character development , barely any detailed plot characteristics , and barely any good acting , but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor . \\r\\nmike myers , with his three roles , acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor , disguising himself completely in one of the roles . \\r\\n ( fat bastard ) all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them . \\r\\nheather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion . \\r\\nspeaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments . \\r\\nhopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures . \\r\\nthe bottom line- a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\ni couldn\\'t find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn\\'t want to be associated with such a lame film . \\r\\nthat\\'s saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they\\'d be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn\\'t . \\r\\nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . \\r\\nthe first three films in the \" vacation \" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80\\'s including mr . \\r\\nmom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller\\'s day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . \\r\\nwowzers ! \\r\\nwhat a r ?

\" \\r\\nand so , as a critic , i\\'m already responsible to ask that same question . \\r\\njackie brown stars pam grier , the \" blaxploitation \" heroine from the 1970\\'s , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character . \\r\\ntarantino\\'s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta\\'s sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier . \\r\\n ( we\\'ve made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction\\'s samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) . \\r\\nordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars . \\r\\ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed . \\r\\nnaturally this proves an obstacle to ordell\\'s plans and , not as friendly intended as we\\'d hope , he posts jackie\\'s bail after she is put behind bars . \\r\\nthe thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he\\'s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way . \\r\\njackie finds herself in a tight squeeze . \\r\\nordell won\\'t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she\\'s always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided . \\r\\nit comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ? \\r\\nwhat ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself . \\r\\ncoming into play is another 70\\'s veteran , robert forster as jackie\\'s bail bondsmen max cherry . \\r\\nmax\\'s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance . \\r\\nalso involved is ordell\\'s \" surfer girl \" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand . \\r\\nfonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there\\'s nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters . \\r\\nde niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself . \\r\\nde niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn\\'t need a de niro to play him . \\r\\ncompared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable . \\r\\nin pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn\\'t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier . \\r\\ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth . \\r\\nsadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life . \\r\\njackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn\\'t as awesome as the first time . \\r\\njules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off . \\r\\nand although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don\\'t think he\\'s quite as irreplaceable . \\r\\nin fact , maybe a new face would have been better . \\r\\njackson could\\'ve remained tarantino\\'s jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories . \\r\\nsadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn\\'t as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules . \\r\\nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning . \\r\\nthis is grier\\'s film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ?

failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one . \\r\\nthe marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli\\'s modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic\\'s intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government . \\r\\ngitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel . \\r\\nthe emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god\\'s law from only the male\\'s view . \\r\\nthat if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are . \\r\\nthe story takes place in jerusalem\\'s jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel . \\r\\nthis is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most

objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . \\r\\nthe film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can\\'t at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace . \\r\\nthe film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god . \\r\\nhe even thanks god that he didn\\'t make him a woman . \\r\\nhis wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom . \\r\\nshe looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv . \\r\\nmeir is a talmudic scholar . \\r\\nhis father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva . \\r\\nhe has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child . \\r\\nsince the hasidim look upon a woman\\'s role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man\\'s role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage . \\r\\nshe receives an anonymous letter that states \" a woman without a child is no better than dead . \" \\r\\nmeir\\'s response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . \\r\\nmeir\\'s father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : \" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . \" \\r\\nall the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren . \\r\\nshe will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel . \\r\\ntheir religion doesn\\'t permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor . \\r\\nrivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion . \\r\\nso when meir\\'s father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters . \\r\\nrivka\\'s spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life . \\r\\nshe has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov . \\r\\nbut , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin . \\r\\nwhen yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his

daughter won\\'t get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn\\'t love . \\r\\nyossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies . \\r\\nthe two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage . \\r\\nthe harshest scene in the film is on malka\\'s wedding night . \\r\\nyossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love . \\r\\nthe sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does . \\r\\nbut the choices are obliterated by one\\'s beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . \\r\\nfor the sisters , the choices are life or death ones . \\r\\ngitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life . \\r\\nthe film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now

british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks . \\r\\nfourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt . \\r\\nfor the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives . \\r\\nthey have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle . \\r\\nalberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility . \\r\\nthe bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident . \\r\\nthe bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it . \\r\\nhowever , according to stephens , there are no \" accidents \" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through . \\r\\nhe goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger . \\r\\nand , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money . \\r\\nhowever , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money . \\r\\nhe is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents . \\r\\nhe has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner . \\r\\nhis daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years . \\r\\nshe calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for . \\r\\n \" i don\\'t know who i\\'m taking to , \" he tells her . \\r\\nin his mind , his daughter is dead . \\r\\nthe lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town\\'s pain , but also his own . \\r\\nhowever , not everyone in town wants it to happen . \\r\\nbilly ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it . \\r\\nhe has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman . \\r\\nhe doesn\\'t want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds . \\r\\nto him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn\\'t need outsiders like stephens getting in the way . \\r\\ncentral to \" the sweet hereafter \" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into \" a wheelchair girl , \" as she puts it . \\r\\naside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out . \\r\\nit is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning\\'s poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town\\'s children away , one was left behind because he was crippled . \\r\\nobviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town\\'s children left her alone by dying in the wreck . \\r\\nher situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) . \\r\\nthere is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film . \\r\\nof all the storylines in \" the sweet hereafter , \" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film . \\r\\negoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn\\'t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up . \\r\\nwhat egoyan has done in \" the sweet hereafter \" is really nothing short of miraculous . \\r\\nin his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life . \\r\\negoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold . \\r\\n \" the sweet hereafter \" is quite the opposite ; egoyan\\'s stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy . \\r\\n \" the sweet hereafter \" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked . \\r\\nthe film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind . \\r\\nthe beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements . \\r\\nlike his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole . \\r\\nhe works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease . \\r\\nthe

' \\r\\nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] \\r\\nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . \\r\\nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . \\r\\nwe know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . ' \\r\\nwe also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . \\r\\nwhat we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . \\r\\nto me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . \\r\\nalso , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . \\r\\nmost notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . \\r\\nfor those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . \\r\\nwith `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights . \\r\\nunfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . \\r\\ni didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . \\r\\nif you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . \\r\\nbut i digress . \\r\\ni've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . \\r\\nall these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . \\r\\nwhat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . \\r\\nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . \\r\\nthe basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . \\r\\nwe're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . \\r\\nwe're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . \\r\\nwe're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . \\r\\nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . \\r\\nthe leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . \\r\\nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . \\r\\nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . \\r\\nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . \\r\\ni have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) . \\r\\nbut it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along . \\r\\nthe film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . \\r\\nthere are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . \\r\\nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . \\r\\nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . \\r\\nas we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . \\r\\nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . \\r\\nto briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . \\r\\ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . \\r\\njinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . \\r\\nthis also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . \\r\\nin fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . \\r\\nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . \\r\\nby the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . \\r\\nit's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . \\r\\nnot that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . \\r\\nand at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . \\r\\nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . \\r\\n`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . \\r\\nso many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . \\r\\nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies . \\r\\n\"),\n",

' \\r\\nthen i realized he was , and i was watching it . \\r\\nin the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . \\r\\nnote : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . \\r\\nmax went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn't seen him since he was a normal-sized kid . \\r\\nher refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as sammy's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . \\r\\ni found this scene offensive . \\r\\nnot only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . \\r\\ni think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . \\r\\nlate in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . \\r\\nthis could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! \\r\\n`my giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . \\r\\na stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person . \\r\\nin this scenario , max's illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . \\r\\nsentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . \\r\\ninstead , we're apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we're not allowed to focus on max . \\r\\ncrystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon . \\r\\n\"),\n",

       " Pandas(Index=503, label='pos', review=\"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable . \\r\\nyou know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is . \\r\\nsure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch . \\r\\nthis cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun . \\r\\none of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story . \\r\\nthis rule applies highly to kiss the girls . \\r\\nthere is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made . \\r\\nhowever , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through . \\r\\nwell , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up . \\r\\nunfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits . \\r\\nthat may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery . \\r\\nhowever , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film . \\r\\nplotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality . \\r\\nwe are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero . \\r\\nhe gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself . \\r\\nobviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene . \\r\\nat his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days . \\r\\nthis provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross . \\r\\nhowever , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . . \\r\\nbefore she is abducted . \\r\\ndr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself . \\r\\nbecause of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful . \\r\\nafter being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods . \\r\\nremembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out . \\r\\nwhen casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall . \\r\\nafter she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice . \\r\\nfrom this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive . \\r\\nmany people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional . \\r\\nthe screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form . \\r\\nwhat makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness . \\r\\nthe cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us . \\r\\nsometimes a simple shot is the best one . \\r\\nhowever , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight . \\r\\nthe scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way . \\r\\nthe camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well . \\r\\nthe chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing . \\r\\nhowever , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors . \\r\\nmorgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors . \\r\\ndetective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven . \\r\\nbecause of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself . \\r\\nthe other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses . \\r\\nin fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible . \\r\\nher character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully . \\r\\nwe finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream . \\r\\nthe supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it . \\r\\ncary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character . \\r\\ntony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either . \\r\\ngina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes . \\r\\nso as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job . \\r\\nsome of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year . \\r\\ntwo other essential aspects of the film are quite good . \\r\\ndirector gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer . \\r\\nhe also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes . \\r\\nhowever , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half . \\r\\npart of the blame falls on david klass . \\r\\ni'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts . \\r\\nwhile this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible . \\r\\nthanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent . \\r\\nnone of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced . \\r\\none of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer . \\r\\ni blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) . \\r\\nkiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex . \\r\\nwith all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain . \\r\\nin fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances . \\r\\nthe cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart . \\r\\nthis is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through . \\r\\nmorgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt . \\r\\ni must also say that i loved the ending . \\r\\nthe showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer . \\r\\nperhaps it may not be possible , but most of the film isn't anyway . \\r\\n\"),\n",

doomed to fail . \\r\\nthe horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated . \\r\\nof course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values . \\r\\nfrom its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell\\'s ( \" being john malkovich \" and \" fargo \" ) musical

though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor . \\r\\nthe key is simplicity . \\r\\n \" blair witch project \" had a story which was incredibly simple . \\r\\nthat allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination . \\r\\nthe film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares . \\r\\nthe effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way . \\r\\n \" book

predecessor . \\r\\nit resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn\\'t always succeed . \\r\\nbut most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn\\'t allow it to destroy the original . \\r\\nin the end , i can\\'t call it a bad effort . \\r\\nit\\'s less artistic , not so scary and less

aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film\\'s vocal work , there\\'s liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . \\r\\nwhile the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can\\'t imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it\\'s rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . \\r\\nthe film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it\\'s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan\\'s land . \\r\\nat its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage . \\r\\nas such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity . \\r\\nscenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan\\'s venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . \\r\\nmulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine\\'s character-defining opening half-hour . \\r\\nit\\'s when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . \\r\\noff to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little \" lucky \" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief . \\r\\nthey\\'re affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity . \\r\\nat training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang . \\r\\neverybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film . \\r\\nthe romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story\\'s neo-feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . \\r\\nanother staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . \\r\\ncomposed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- \" i\\'ll make a man out of you \" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . \\r\\nonly \" reflections \" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre\\'s most wondrously pure voices . \\r\\nnonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . \\r\\nwhile the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they\\'re not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . \\r\\nbriskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\na few months later , volcano was released . \\r\\nthe first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . \\r\\nthe latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . \\r\\nwell , it\\'s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . \\r\\nthis time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . \\r\\nof course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante\\'s peak . \\r\\nbut while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film . \\r\\napparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . \\r\\nto be completely honest , i haven\\'t had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . \\r\\nvolcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch . \\r\\ndeep impact doesn\\'t just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot . \\r\\nthe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . \\r\\ndeep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) . \\r\\na line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . \\r\\namong these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . \\r\\nleo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . \\r\\nhe races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident . \\r\\na year passes , and nothing is heard about it again . \\r\\nwe are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . \\r\\nshe gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . \\r\\nshe talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . \\r\\nafter talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . \\r\\nluckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain \" ellie \" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . \\r\\nthat girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . \\r\\nbefore she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . \\r\\nthey take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . \\r\\nbeck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . \\r\\nnaturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . \\r\\nand so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . \\r\\nthey announce a plan called \" ark , \" which is their only hope for survival . \\r\\na computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . \\r\\nthese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won\\'t kill off the entire human race . \\r\\nafter two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . \\r\\nthe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . \\r\\njenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . \\r\\nthe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . \\r\\nit\\'s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . \\r\\nnow , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . \\r\\nthe title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! \\r\\nby doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won\\'t work . \\r\\ndirector mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show \" er . \" \\r\\nher major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . \\r\\nwell , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one . \\r\\nsuggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . \\r\\nmuch of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off . \\r\\nthroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . \\r\\nit literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it\\'s that boring . \\r\\nof course , leder isn\\'t all to blame for it . \\r\\nscreenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . \\r\\nwhat starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . \\r\\nchock full of cheesy one liners ( \" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! \" ) \\r\\nand stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again . \\r\\nonly one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring . \\r\\nand the main plot is so outrageous that you can\\'t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . \\r\\nto put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . \\r\\nthat\\'s right , 80% miss , and 20% hit . \\r\\nscenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . \\r\\nbut the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening . \\r\\nthe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that\\'s forgiveable . \\r\\nwhat isn\\'t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . \\r\\ngive me a break , will ya ? \\r\\nand of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . \\r\\nwell , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant . \\r\\nthe water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous . \\r\\ncgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . \\r\\nin fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . \\r\\njust when we think visual effects can\\'t be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . \\r\\none thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder\\'s direction , which also influences the actors . \\r\\nleder loves to show the actors\\' faces before and during moments of terror . \\r\\nthis reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . \\r\\nbut harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . \\r\\nleder likes to flaunt people\\'s fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . \\r\\none moment has an astronaut flying off into space . \\r\\nthis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person\\'s face while drifting into space . \\r\\nthis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . \\r\\non another note , leder\\'s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . \\r\\nthe pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . \\r\\nthen again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it\\'s obvious it will be emotional . \\r\\nit\\'s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into \" feeling \" for the characters , but it didn\\'t work for me . \\r\\nbut anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . \\r\\nt ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv\\'s \" the naked truth \" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role . \\r\\nher character is made stronger by leoni\\'s presence , and we grow to care for her . \\r\\nrobert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . \\r\\nelijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn\\'t had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! \\r\\nyou are too talented for this stuff ) . \\r\\nvanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . \\r\\nmaximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor . \\r\\nmorgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . \\r\\nleelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character . \\r\\na special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . \\r\\neldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot . \\r\\ncrosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv\\'s \" star trek : the next generation . \" \\r\\nseeing her was one of the highlights of the film . \\r\\noverall , a very talented cast virtually wasted . \\r\\ndeep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . \\r\\nthis is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever . \\r\\nluckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . \\r\\nit\\'s a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn\\'t worth much . \\r\\ncosting nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . \\r\\nwell , it\\'s not . \\r\\nwhen the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it . \\r\\n'),\n",

       " Pandas(Index=526, label='pos', review='is it just me , or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ? \\r\\ni was almost stunned by the quality of \" who framed roger rabbit ? \" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together . \\r\\n \" the little mermaid \" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century . \\r\\nhowever , the endless stream of \" the little mermaid \" wanna-be\\'s is getting to me . \\r\\nyou know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke . \\r\\nit\\'s a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome . \\r\\nthat\\'s why i\\'m delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio . \\r\\nfrom what i\\'ve seen of their movies ( \" kiki\\'s delivery service \" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed \" my neighbor totoro \" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat . \\r\\nthese movies , particularly \" kiki\\'s delivery service , \" are wonderfully original and entertaining . \\r\\n \" kiki\\'s delivery service \" starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home . \\r\\nthis is unusual because kiki isn\\'t a college student or a young adult making her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch . \\r\\nher mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance . \\r\\njust the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki\\'s mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom . \\r\\nkiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to . \\r\\ninitially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she\\'s discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch . \\r\\non the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it . \\r\\nthe favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one-persons delivery service . \\r\\nthis is where the movie becomes shockingly good . \\r\\nkiki\\'s job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her . \\r\\nthe townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn\\'t seem forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light . \\r\\nthey\\'re three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl . \\r\\nhowever , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique . \\r\\nthe personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950\\'s . \\r\\nthis beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at . \\r\\ni could probably go on all day , but i won\\'t ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie . \\r\\nsome of my favorites are kiki\\'s relationship with the baker\\'s husband : although he\\'s quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship . \\r\\nin the garage of a deliveree\\'s house can be found a vintage model t . two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master-servant to friend-friend . \\r\\nsuch details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg . \\r\\nadded on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self-worth . \\r\\nkiki initially seems to derive much of her self-worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty . \\r\\nthis causes kiki to lose faith in herself . \\r\\nhowever , kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings , but the innate beauty inside her . \\r\\nseeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don\\'t even want to hint at it . \\r\\nthe ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney-esque moment i\\'ve ever seen ; if you don\\'t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention . \\r\\nthe movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki\\'s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes . \\r\\nhowever , i would be surprised if disney doesn\\'t give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian . \\r\\nrefreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self-contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into . \\r\\n \" beauty and the beast \" \\'s beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person\\'s inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing . \\r\\nkiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self-image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film . \\r\\nanother difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for \" kiki\\'s delivery service \" : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t . this is particularly true with scenes of kiki\\'s flights . \\r\\nthe extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i\\'ve ever seen . \\r\\ni\\'m not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states . \\r\\ndisney tentatively plans a theater release of \" monoko hime \" shortly following the summer \\'97 japanese release , and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that . \\r\\ni\\'d guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release . \\r\\nalthough the wait is unfortunate , it\\'s good to know that it\\'s being released at all , for \" kiki\\'s delivery service \" is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release . \\r\\nwatch this movie . \\r\\nalong with \" man bites dog , \" and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i\\'ve ever seen . \\r\\n'),\n",

the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro . \\r\\nalone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness . \\r\\nat first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love . \\r\\nlater when he reads frankenstein\\'s journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge . \\r\\nhe is capable of killing without regret . \\r\\n \" i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and \\r\\nthen i slowly crushed his neck . . . and \\r\\nas i killed him , i saw your face . . \" \\r\\nthat is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator . \\r\\nand yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : \" for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all . \" \\r\\nrarely has a cinematic interpretation of \" the daemon \" approached the level of three-dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel . \\r\\nanother vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein . \\r\\nin most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm . \\r\\nalmost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel . \\r\\nhere , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene . \\r\\nbranagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character . \\r\\non the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past . \\r\\nhelen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein\\'s surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart . \\r\\nthe rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing . \\r\\nvisually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) . \\r\\nthe spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley\\'s frankenstein is a wonder to behold . \\r\\nkenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : \" . . all \\r\\ni once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by \\r\\nmy hand . . \" . \\r\\nand the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator\\'s body on fire . \\r\\nthe film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness . \\r\\nand a terrifying last close-up on the creature\\'s smiling face . \\r\\ncan a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ? \\r\\nto whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ? \\r\\nshelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them . \\r\\nfollowing her example , branagh does the same . \\r\\nhis film is a tragic saga about playing god . \\r\\nvictor frankenstein is not an evil man . \\r\\nhe wanted to change the world to the better . \\r\\nin this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions . \\r\\nproduced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film \" dracula \" . \\r\\nin comparison , i can say that \" dracula \" has visuals that even \" frankenstein \" can not live up to . \\r\\nbut when it comes to story , characters and casting , \" frankenstein \" is stronger . \\r\\nbut stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan\\'s \" interview with the vampire \" . \\r\\nalthough the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating . \\r\\nbranagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly\\'s classic novel . \\r\\n'),\n",

great flicks . \\r\\nas much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something . \\r\\ni learned from scorsese\\'s casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . \\r\\nno mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . \\r\\nfor example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other . \\r\\nthere was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on . \\r\\nor toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building . \\r\\nagain , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing . \\r\\ni don\\'t mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking . \\r\\nbut he simply uses the best tool for the job . \\r\\nit shouldn\\'t have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward . \\r\\nthe movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet . \\r\\nthe movie\\'s title is another name for the dalai lama which means \" ocean of wisdom . \" \\r\\nhis story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story . \\r\\n ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film\\'s opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) \\r\\nwe first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . \\r\\nhis curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . \\r\\na test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . \\r\\nseveral items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . \\r\\nthe child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . \\r\\nthe boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . \\r\\nscorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . \\r\\nbefore selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . \\r\\nsometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . \\r\\neither way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . \\r\\n>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama\\'s spirit and the future leader of a nation . \\r\\nit is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . \\r\\nin the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . \\r\\nbut the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . \\r\\nneither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person . \\r\\ncertain patterns take shape over the years . \\r\\nfor example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . \\r\\nradios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . \\r\\nwhen he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . \\r\\nhe also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . \\r\\nit\\'s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . \\r\\nbut the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet\\'s gigantic neighbor , china . \\r\\ntibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . \\r\\nthe chinese invasion is so successful that the lama\\'s life is in danger if he stays . \\r\\nthe movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . \\r\\nthe story doesn\\'t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . \\r\\nit just doesn\\'t fit that mold . \\r\\nif it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . \\r\\nthe pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . \\r\\nthe structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa . \\r\\nperhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . \\r\\na mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . \\r\\nthe robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . \\r\\nthe bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . \\r\\neven the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . \\r\\nphilip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . \\r\\nfor those who don\\'t know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . \\r\\nhis building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . \\r\\nthese patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . \\r\\npeople won\\'t be flocking to kundun for it\\'s great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . \\r\\nit gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . \\r\\non top of it all is the cinematic

\" , \\r\\nbut \" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? \" \\r\\ndicaprio is a revelation . \\r\\ni hadn\\'t seen him before in anything , and didn\\'t know what the heck to expect , really . \\r\\n ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . ) \\r\\ndicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it\\'s hard not to like him . \\r\\nfrom the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters . \\r\\nwinslet\\'s character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance . \\r\\nat first , she\\'s not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous . \\r\\nwe know from the narration that she\\'s monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn\\'t any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio . \\r\\nwinslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg . \\r\\nit\\'s at that moment where winslet\\'s character really comes alive . \\r\\nfaced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job . \\r\\nas rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal\\'s fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror . \\r\\nof course , the most interesting character is the ship itself . \\r\\ncameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain\\'s table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead . \\r\\ncameron\\'s greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well . \\r\\n'),\n",

\" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court . \\r\\nspielberg\\'s direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque\\'s angry outburst in the court room . \\r\\nstill , there isn\\'t enough of this for it to be a serious problem . \\r\\nthe main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can\\'t quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . \\r\\nthis summer\\'s contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . \\r\\n \" amistad \" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . \\r\\nperhaps the best way to describe it is this : \" amistad \" is three four star films edited into one . \\r\\nalmost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . \\r\\nhowever , i can\\'t honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery . \\r\\n'),\n",

       " Pandas(Index=547, label='pos', review='what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker . \\r\\nthe dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! \\r\\ni can hear batfans everywhere protesting : \" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! \" \\r\\nand , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play . \\r\\nnicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman . \\r\\nnicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the \\'60s tv series ) . \\r\\non one hand , nicholson\\'s joker is extremely funny . \\r\\nhis murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film . \\r\\nbut on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . \\r\\nthe joker\\'s cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister . \\r\\nthis guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it ! \\r\\nbut enough about nicholson as the joker : i\\'m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman . \\r\\nlike many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader . \\r\\nbut batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting ! \\r\\nkeaton delivers . \\r\\nhe is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman . \\r\\neven though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city . \\r\\nvisually , batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team . \\r\\nthe movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as \" the dark knight returns \" and \" the killing joke . \" \\r\\nburton\\'s film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen . \\r\\nthe sets , costumes , and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations . \\r\\nnicholson isn\\'t joking when he boasts , \" wait \\'till they get a load of me ! \" \\r\\nhis grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous . \\r\\nkeaton\\'s wardrobe is equally appropriate . \\r\\nbatman\\'s cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not adam west\\'s campy costume in the tv series but peter weir\\'s outfit in robocop . \\r\\nproduction designer anton furst\\'s sets are a wonder . \\r\\ngotham city is dark and foreboding , almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york . \\r\\nthe batcave is cold , bare , and desolate . \\r\\nthe world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption . \\r\\nthe movie\\'s gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold . \\r\\nthe plot , on the other hand , is not as rousing . \\r\\nthe screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting . \\r\\nit takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear . \\r\\nbatman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology , but it fails to give us enough of either one . \\r\\nas i mentioned earlier , the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker , but it never fully establishes batman\\'s psychological motives and underpinnings . \\r\\nin terms of action , batman is not as thrilling as you might expect . \\r\\nburton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story . \\r\\nmore than anything , batman is a mood film . \\r\\nwhile batman may not completely absorb and excite you , it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books . \\r\\nthanks to its distinctive look , the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\nthe film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them . \\r\\nit doesn\\'t simply plug in the \" right thing \" at the \" right time , \" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant . \\r\\nbuilding a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? \\r\\nwe\\'re given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o\\'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time . \\r\\nshe knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her . \\r\\nright from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be . \\r\\nbeing the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e . \\r\\nwho will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e . \\r\\ngetting married just to spite someone ) . \\r\\nthe man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him . \\r\\nhe isn\\'t so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he\\'s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his . \\r\\nher name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see . \\r\\nshe and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband . \\r\\nher meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn\\'t give her much emotional self-defense . \\r\\nacting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) . \\r\\nhe\\'s quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he\\'s got a bad reputation . \\r\\nbutler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior . \\r\\nhe tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn\\'t seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition . \\r\\nfor example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there\\'s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out . \\r\\nthis angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that . \\r\\n \" do we have ammunition factories ? \\r\\ndo we have food ? \\r\\ndo we have a navy ? \\r\\nall we have is tobacco . \" \\r\\nall true statements and yet the south still insists he\\'s wrong . \\r\\nbutler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it\\'s appealing . \\r\\nscarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he\\'s not going to stop until he has her . \\r\\nbut scarlett can\\'t get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever . \\r\\nand so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life . \\r\\nthe conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is \" marked \" for life when her first husband dies . \\r\\nthis gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story . \\r\\nsome are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film . \\r\\nin most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance . \\r\\neven people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set . \\r\\nthe costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place . \\r\\nthe filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken . \\r\\nthe first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war . \\r\\nfleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is . \\r\\none scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , \" no ! \\r\\nnot my leg ! \\r\\ndon\\'t cut off my leg ! \" \\r\\nanother scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that\\'s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be . \\r\\nas the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north . \\r\\nshe manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can\\'t help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south\\'s ultimate defeat . \\r\\nthis brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship . \\r\\nmost of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . \\r\\neach uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other . \\r\\nscarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can\\'t help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business . \\r\\nthey say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization . \\r\\nthey need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together . \\r\\nperhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call . \\r\\nboth have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other . \\r\\nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we\\'re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . \\r\\ngable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture . \\r\\nall ? \\r\\nnone ? \\r\\neither way is possible and it\\'s a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings . \\r\\nit\\'s safe to say most of us won\\'t live such overly dramatic lives as those in \" gone with the wind , \" but it\\'s still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we\\'ve just experienced a life\\'s worth of joy and pain . \\r\\n'),\n",

see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . \\r\\nas a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent

in a film . \\r\\n \" in the heat of the night \" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . \\r\\njewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . \\r\\nin these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . \\r\\nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . \\r\\npreceding the very original \" a soldier\\'s story \" and the recently released \" the hurricane , \" \" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . \\r\\nthe film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . \\r\\ntibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . \\r\\nas a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist . \\r\\npoitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character . \\r\\nnever nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . \\r\\nhowever , unlike \" the hurricane \" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance . \\r\\nas a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . \\r\\nhe starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . \\r\\nhe would refer to tibbs as \" boy \" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . \\r\\nas the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . \\r\\nhe begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . \\r\\nwhat i really enjoyed about steiger\\'s character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . \\r\\nhe still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . \\r\\ninstead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . \\r\\nmost movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . \\r\\nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . \\r\\njewison\\'s determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . \\r\\n \" in the heat of the night \" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960\\'s . \\r\\nit displays this perfectly . \\r\\nhowever , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest . \\r\\nit seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . \\r\\nthere were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . \\r\\nalso , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out

trash . \\r\\njosie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times . \\r\\nshe has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office . \\r\\nbut she is very much dismayed with her position in life . \\r\\nthere is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media . \\r\\nso when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation . \\r\\nconstantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c . reilly ) . \\r\\nthe two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter . \\r\\nhowever , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field . \\r\\nobviously , the field assignment involves a high school . \\r\\nspecifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and \" becoming one of them . \" \\r\\ni don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t . \\r\\nthe movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school . \\r\\ninterwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again . \\r\\nfortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting . \\r\\nthey include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body . \\r\\nalso , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative . \\r\\nthe humor found in this film is actually quite amusing . \\r\\ntypical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor . \\r\\none scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical . \\r\\nmost of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy . \\r\\nbut those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie . \\r\\nfollowing this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting . \\r\\nit is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film . \\r\\nin this case , drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch . \\r\\nshe is required to play her character on two levels , having some very black and white transitions . \\r\\nand although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray , she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time . \\r\\nat one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel , and is expected to him on an adult level , since he is one , her teacher . \\r\\nbut she never seems to get out of the gray area , and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance . \\r\\nfollowing barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon ( saturday night live ) . \\r\\nshe seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to , and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic . \\r\\nit is these \" qualities \" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent . \\r\\nluckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film . \\r\\ndavid arquette ( scream ) takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic , and not have his brilliant acting ruined . \\r\\nand as a central character he gets to take on his own mini-plot , which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed . \\r\\nin a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of work , he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit , risky business . \\r\\nnever been kissed is a mediocre film at best . \\r\\nthe predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood , that it is sickening to watch time and again , and this film is no exception . \\r\\nthe acting is just as bad , but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light . \\r\\nunfortunately , the bottom line is that the movie will be a success , because teenagers will pay to see any trash . \\r\\n'),\n",

( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . . \\r\\nand immediately tanked at the box office . \\r\\nwhether it was because fox wasn\\'t quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn\\'t quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop . \\r\\nit seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters . \\r\\na year later , something entirely strange and magical happened . \\r\\nprints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film . \\r\\nthis new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time . \\r\\nword quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show\\'s life as the ultimate cult film was born . \\r\\nfor the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton . \\r\\nbrad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed . \\r\\nthey plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home . \\r\\nremembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance . \\r\\nthe castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) . \\r\\nfrank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) . \\r\\nas rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter\\'s mad schemes . \\r\\nlittle do any of them know that the doctor\\'s handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o\\'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth . \\r\\ngoing back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has . \\r\\nif i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don\\'t think i would have known what to make of it either . \\r\\nfor all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film . \\r\\nby the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o\\'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on . \\r\\nwhen i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity . \\r\\nit goes without saying that the \" time warp \" is the most popular song in the film . \\r\\neven people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song . \\r\\nwhat those who haven\\'t seen the movie don\\'t know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment . \\r\\nmy personal favorite is \" over at the frankenstein place \" , but \" dammit janet \" is also maddeningly catchy . \\r\\ntim curry\\'s vocals on the rocking tune \" sweet transvestite \" need to be heard to be believed . \\r\\nthe finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . . \\r\\nfrightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( \" rose tint my world \" , \" don\\'t dream it \" , \" wild and untamed thing \" , and \" i\\'m going home \" ) , all of which are immensely singable . \\r\\nthe film\\'s true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though . \\r\\ndespite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn\\'t have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show . \\r\\nwatching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don\\'t mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) . \\r\\nnote : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton . \\r\\nthe two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own . \\r\\no\\'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original . \\r\\n25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world . \\r\\nas a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) . \\r\\nif you are one of those people who can\\'t get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites . \\r\\nin an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it\\'ll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all . \\r\\nthe film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) . \\r\\nthe film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called \" superheroes \" . \\r\\nfor ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen . \\r\\noriginally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) . \\r\\nmost reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced . \\r\\nthe film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o\\'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) . \\r\\nthe two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) . \\r\\nfox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments . \\r\\nthe first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is . \\r\\nthe second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show . \\r\\nmost of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter . \\r\\nthe final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote . \\r\\nwhen selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world . \\r\\nonce the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off . \\r\\nthe first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player . \\r\\nthere is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don\\'t know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don\\'t know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff\\'s story lab . \\r\\nlinks to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc . \\r\\nthe second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras . \\r\\nformer lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the \" behind the music : rocky horror \" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung \" hot patootie \" . \\r\\nthe \" behind the music \" segments are all very interesting , especially richard o\\'brien\\'s jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot . \\r\\nthere are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o\\'brien , and meat loaf interviews . \\r\\nas far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here . \\r\\none of which is just the \" superheroes \" number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called \" once in a while \" . \\r\\na series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick\\'s pants ) . \\r\\nfor the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here . \\r\\nrounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is \" a different sort of jaws \" ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for \" toucha toucha touch me \" and \" sweet transvestite \" ) . \\r\\nfox\\'s special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( \" you\\'re lucky . . . \\r\\ni\\'m lucky . . . \\r\\nhe\\'s lucky . . . \\r\\nwe\\'re all lucky ! \" ) . \\r\\nit\\'s not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format . \\r\\nas with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want . \\r\\ni raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b-movie tradition . \\r\\n[r] \\r\\n'),\n",
       " Pandas(Index=611, label='pos', review='seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . \\r\\nwhen it comes to modern gangster movies , it\\'s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word \" routine . \" \\r\\ni\\'ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it\\'s been used before ) can provide for a good story and \" donnie brasco \" clinches this idea . \\r\\nit\\'s not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another\\'s style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . \\r\\nthe film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . \\r\\nwe meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . \\r\\nhe and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . \\r\\nsomehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn\\'t afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . \\r\\nit\\'s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . \\r\\ni have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . \\r\\nhowever , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . \\r\\nthe first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . \\r\\nthe screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . \\r\\nmost gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . \\r\\nthankfully the film doesn\\'t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . \\r\\nmuch of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . \\r\\npacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . \\r\\nhe\\'s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . \\r\\nwe learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it\\'s easy to sympathize with him . \\r\\nnewell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . \\r\\nas donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it\\'s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . \\r\\nmost of the film tells the story of donnie\\'s life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn\\'t always seem to come together as a whole . \\r\\nthe storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . \\r\\nthe resonance to donnie\\'s actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn\\'t always seem to have much meaning . \\r\\nback home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he\\'s never a and the family is suffering . \\r\\nsince this is based on a true story i wouldn\\'t doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . \\r\\nmy only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . \\r\\na climax of sorts does occur , but there\\'s little feeling of a payoff . \\r\\nwe get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . \\r\\naside from a few minor , general flaws , \" donnie brasco \" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . \\r\\nit may be routine , but it\\'s good , and that\\'s respectful . \\r\\n'),\n",

is it all it\\'s hyped up to be ? \\r\\nwell , yes ? and no . \\r\\nit\\'s a good film , and there\\'s a lot to like about it , but it\\'s not without its problems . \\r\\nwhen i saw the first trailer for \" titanic \" , it was when i went to see \" bean \" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain\\'t that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? ! \\r\\ni mean , what\\'s happened to hollywood\\'s script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ? \\r\\ngads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ? \\r\\ni was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn\\'t alone in that respect . \\r\\nit\\'s when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who\\'d been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice ! \\r\\ni didn\\'t see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , \\r\\nso i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn\\'t think i\\'d enjoy it much . \\r\\ndid i ? yes and no . \\r\\nmainly yes , i\\'m happy to say . \\r\\nthe first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i\\'ll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron\\'s directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the \" human \" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting . \\r\\nthe film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a\\' course ! \\r\\n : - ) ) . \\r\\nwell , it\\'s an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat . \\r\\ndoes it work here ? \\r\\nin script form it doesn\\'t add all that much to the story . \\r\\nwhat does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film . \\r\\nher presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her . \\r\\nalso impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving . \\r\\nit\\'s an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack\\'s \" rescuing \" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching . \\r\\nin fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance . \\r\\nit\\'s engaging , touching and very enjoyable . \\r\\nthere\\'s more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it\\'s not going to be a happy ending . \\r\\nwhich leads us to the second half of the film . \\r\\nwe all knew it was coming . \\r\\ni\\'m sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he\\'s stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film . \\r\\ni think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die . \\r\\nthe iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour . \\r\\nand it is an hour . \\r\\nmy goodness , we don\\'t miss a second of that hour ? \\r\\ngratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today\\'s standards , i\\'m sure there\\'s been far worse produced under the banner of \" entertainment \" in other films . \\r\\nbut i certainly wasn\\'t prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be . \\r\\nnot that i\\'d expect the word \" understatement \" to be part of cameron\\'s vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as \" terminator 2 \" and \" aliens \" ) . \\r\\nis it overdone ? \\r\\ni thought so . \\r\\nunderstatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy . \\r\\nno , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn\\'t quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film\\'s second half . \\r\\nstill , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears ! \\r\\nyou really couldn\\'t help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose\\'s overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive . \\r\\nperhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface . \\r\\nthe bit where rose lets go of jack\\'s hand , while promising she\\'ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it . \\r\\ni loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half . \\r\\nso , we\\'ve established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive . \\r\\nhaven\\'t mentioned the script . \\r\\nplot-wise it\\'s ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i\\'ve a feeling that\\'s to the actors credit if anything . \\r\\nas for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 . \\r\\nit\\'s a period drama . \\r\\nbut i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned . \\r\\ndid they really use phrases like \" goddamn it ! \" \\r\\nback in the turn of the century ? \\r\\ni doubt it . \\r\\nwould someone talk like this : \" do ya love the guy or what ? \" . \\r\\ni doubt it . \\r\\nis such dialogue as \" i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now \" not just a bit ? clumsy ? \\r\\nyes it is . \\r\\na little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) . \\r\\nstick with directing , dude . \\r\\nbut its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast . \\r\\nstar of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn\\'t she win that oscar ? ! \\r\\nafter all , they were throwing oscars at \" titanic \" left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee . \\r\\ndirecting-wise cameron does a spectacular job . \\r\\nlike i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well . \\r\\ni haven\\'t even mentioned james horner\\'s beautiful score . \\r\\nutterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it ! \\r\\n ; - ) \\r\\ni\\'ve finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would ! \\r\\njust leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ? \\r\\nhell , don\\'t talk to me about oscars . \\r\\nbloomin\\' farce . \\r\\nit was deserving in a number of departments , though . \\r\\nlast question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ? \\r\\nnope , i don\\'t think so . \\r\\nit\\'s certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i\\'ve ever seen , but i don\\'t think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites . \\r\\nand as for the fact they\\'re reportedly making a \" titanic 2 \" ? well i guess that\\'s typical hollywood for you ! \\r\\n'),\n",
       " Pandas(Index=616, label='pos', review='scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . \\r\\nduring a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . \\r\\na few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . \\r\\n . \\r\\n . \\r\\nscream 2 ! \\r\\n1996\\'s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! \\r\\na sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . \\r\\nin fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! \\r\\nsidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . \\r\\nmeanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled \" stab \" , which has been developed into a major motion picture . \\r\\nas scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of \" stab \" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . \\r\\nthis marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown \" copycat \" sets out to repeat what\\'s been done . \\r\\n . \\r\\n . \\r\\nand finish what hasn\\'t ! \\r\\nof course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . \\r\\nthis is in large part due to williamson\\'s deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . \\r\\nas much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you\\'re not bound to complain . \\r\\ni will note , however , that the \" whodunit ? \" \\r\\ndid wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . \\r\\nall the actors outdo themselves here . \\r\\nwe\\'re not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . \\r\\nthe characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . \\r\\nwe can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don\\'t lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . \\r\\nthe nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn\\'t seem off-kilter from it\\'s predecessor . \\r\\nit\\'s a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . \\r\\nwe skip two years , but there doesn\\'t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . \\r\\nit flows so well that you feel more like you\\'re reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) \\r\\nthan just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . \\r\\nwhile main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2\\'s entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . \\r\\nas i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it\\'s precursor . \\r\\nthe only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . \\r\\nthis doesn\\'t mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it\\'s sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it\\'s own while maintaining it\\'s sought-after qualities . \\r\\nif ever a film followed it\\'s original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . \\r\\nscream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . \\r\\nit would top off the series quite well , if it weren\\'t for the fact that two movies don\\'t really make a series . \\r\\nit\\'s unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won\\'t appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let\\'s hope they can keep up the fantastic work . \\r\\nlike they say , don\\'t mess with perfection . \\r\\n . \\r\\n . \\r\\nbut when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who\\'s gonna listen ?

       " Pandas(Index=621, label='pos', review='star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) \\r\\nreview by matt pusateri \\r\\nfew movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas\\' 1977 classic , star wars . \\r\\nthe original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \\r\\narguably , more americans today can explain what \" the force \" or a \" jedi \" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \\r\\nso 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \\r\\ncan a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \\r\\nagainst this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \\r\\nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \\r\\nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \\r\\nit is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \\r\\nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \\r\\nas the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \\r\\nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \\r\\nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo\\'s young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \\r\\nlater , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \\r\\non tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \\r\\nqui-gon senses the child is \" unusually strong \" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be \" the one \" prophesized to \" bring balance to the force . \" \\r\\nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \\r\\ncomplicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \\r\\nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \\r\\nif the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \\r\\nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin\\'s turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \\r\\nbut the complexity is not overwhelming . \\r\\nthe story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \\r\\none of the reasons the film\\'s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \\r\\nit\\'s unclear whose story phantom menace is . \\r\\nin the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke\\'s story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \\r\\nbut it\\'s unclear whether this new film is anakin\\'s story or obi-wan\\'s . \\r\\nif this trilogy is centered on anakin , it\\'s a shaky foundation . \\r\\nlloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \\r\\non screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is \" the one . \" \\r\\nthe rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \\r\\nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \\r\\nmcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \\r\\nportman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \\r\\nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \\r\\nindividually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \\r\\nbut unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn\\'t do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \\r\\nin star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \\r\\nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \\r\\nin the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \\r\\nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \\r\\nindividually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \\r\\nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \\r\\nbut despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \\r\\nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas\\' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \\r\\nfirst , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \\r\\nthe characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing \" destroyers \" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \\r\\neach location is elaborate and complex . \\r\\nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \\r\\nmost of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren\\'t possible when the films were made . \\r\\nmore than ever , in this new film , lucas\\' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \\r\\nthe best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \\r\\nwatto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \\r\\nof all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \\r\\nspeaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \\r\\nwith more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas\\' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \\r\\njar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon\\'s accidental sidekick . \\r\\njar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \\r\\nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \\r\\nhowever , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn\\'t completely convincing . \\r\\nhe still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \\r\\nthroughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a \" roger rabbit \" -like presence . \\r\\nyou accept that he\\'s there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \\r\\ninitially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \\r\\non my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn\\'t mind him at all . \\r\\na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \\r\\ndespite all the film\\'s struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one\\'s destiny and \" the force , \" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \\r\\nfortunately , lucas hasn\\'t lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \\r\\nfrom the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film\\'s thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \\r\\nin the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \\r\\nand finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \\r\\nfrom beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \\r\\nthe pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \\r\\nthe phantom menace won\\'t win any major oscars . \\r\\nit probably won\\'t beat titanic\\'s box office record . \\r\\nand it\\'s not even the best star wars film ( i\\'d put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \\r\\nbut it\\'s an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \\r\\nthe film can\\'t live up to it\\'s hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \\r\\nbut it\\'s still worth seeing . . . \\r\\nprobably more than once . \\r\\n'),\n",

sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . \\r\\nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . \\r\\nhopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . \\r\\nwhichever one you like , dear , he says . \\r\\nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . \\r\\ni liked that scene for two reasons . \\r\\nfirst , the cakes looked really cool . \\r\\nsecond , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . \\r\\nmeet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . \\r\\nit\\'s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it\\'s even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . \\r\\nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . \\r\\ni know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . \\r\\ncase in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . \\r\\nhowever , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . \\r\\n ( it\\'s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) \\r\\nit shouldn\\'t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . \\r\\nand indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . \\r\\nwell , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . \\r\\nso , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . \\r\\nanyway , the deceased lawyer\\'s body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . \\r\\nthe idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . \\r\\nif this weren\\'t hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who\\'s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn\\'t know how to act in our society . \\r\\nit also doesn\\'t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . \\r\\nhe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . \\r\\nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . \\r\\nhe knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . \\r\\nand as played by brad pitt , he\\'s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he\\'s just there . \\r\\nit\\'s as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . \" \\r\\nit\\'s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . \\r\\ni\\'ve used the phrase \" angel of death \" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt\\'s performance with this year\\'s best angel performance , nicolas cage\\'s in city of angels . \\r\\nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . \\r\\nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . \\r\\ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani\\'s character is so shallow that she can\\'t see beyond pitt\\'s good looks . \\r\\nthe movie\\'s other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn\\'t save meet joe black . \\r\\nsir anthony hopkins isn\\'t given much better material to work with , unfortunately . \\r\\nhe plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . \\r\\n ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins\\'s character more realistically evil . ) \\r\\nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . \\r\\nof course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . \\r\\nbut i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . \\r\\nhopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . \\r\\nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i\\'m sure . \\r\\ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i\\'m asking myself why . \\r\\nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i\\'m going to

) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . \\r\\nthe visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . \\r\\nall of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . \\r\\nit\\'s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\nyeah , me too . ) \\r\\nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \\r\\ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \\r\\nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \\r\\ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \\r\\nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \\r\\nbut by the end of the film , they\\'re still doing the same schitck ; it hasn\\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\\'t been dropped either . \\r\\nthat\\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \\r\\n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \\r\\nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\\'s actions . \\r\\nthis doesn\\'t really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\\'s condition early on , so they don\\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \\r\\nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \\r\\njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \\r\\nit\\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \\r\\ncarrey doesn\\'t pull any stunts we don\\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\\' script doesn\\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\\'t set up in any meaningful way . \\r\\nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \\r\\nzellweger\\'s irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \\r\\nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \\r\\nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \\r\\nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \\r\\nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \\r\\nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \\r\\nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \\r\\nbut i don\\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \\r\\nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\\'ll rebound just fine . \\r\\neven after that happens , though , i\\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \\r\\n'),\n",

a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson\\'s the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . \\r\\nall of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . \\r\\nwhat remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . \\r\\nthe look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . \\r\\nthe frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . \\r\\nbut it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren\\'t equally as interesting , and are they ever . \\r\\nin addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna\\'s pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . \\r\\ngaulthier\\'s outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson\\'s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . \\r\\nwhile besson\\'s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . \\r\\nfor all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . \\r\\ni really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . \\r\\nat first this character\\'s hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . \\r\\nnot irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . \\r\\nthe tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra\\'s innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . \\r\\nthen there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . \\r\\nthe story\\'s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . \\r\\nwhile still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . \\r\\nthe big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . \\r\\nas such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . \\r\\nthis suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the \" enemy \" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made . \\r\\nstill , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ;

\" \\r\\nor some variant thereof . \\r\\nconversations should have been literally sprinkled with the \" f \" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex . \\r\\nthis is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an \" r \" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film . \\r\\nhowever , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic . \\r\\nthe most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg . \\r\\nhe cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it . \\r\\nas if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler\\'s list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler\\'s monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller\\'s last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain . \\r\\nthat particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film . \\r\\nnowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) . \\r\\nbecause of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows . \\r\\n . \\r\\n'),\n",

american history x \" does it , and for that , i commend it . \\r\\nit not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who\\'s not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off . \\r\\nthe subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack . \\r\\nhe\\'s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks . \\r\\nhe\\'s so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process . \\r\\nhis name is derek vinyard , and he\\'s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he\\'s almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he\\'s clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he\\'s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn\\'t need them . \\r\\nhe so believes in his convictions that he\\'s willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years . \\r\\n \" american history x \" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake . \\r\\nwe see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he\\'s done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides . \\r\\nor at least , that\\'s the intention . \\r\\nthe film\\'s framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek\\'s deep space 9 ) , is trying to \" correct \" him . \\r\\nwhen the film opens , danny has just written a book report on \" mein kampf , \" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek\\'s life and how it has gotten him nowhere . \\r\\ncoincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he\\'s cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . \\r\\nhe\\'s just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he\\'s wisened up . \\r\\nhe\\'s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who\\'s becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . \\r\\nbut danny won\\'t . \\r\\nhe goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . \\r\\nthe film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . \\r\\nwe mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . \\r\\nto them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . \\r\\nand frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . \\r\\n \" american history x \" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . \\r\\nin it , there are some of the best scenes i\\'ve seen all year . \\r\\none scene features a dinner between derek\\'s family , and his mother\\'s newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek\\'s rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould\\'s reaction to derek\\'s final summation is unnerrving ) . \\r\\nanother scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . \\r\\nand another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . \\r\\nthere\\'s much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d\\'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he\\'s given in what seems like a really long time ) . \\r\\nnorton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . \\r\\nin only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . \\r\\nthere\\'s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . \\r\\nthat he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . \\r\\nsadly enough , this isn\\'t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . \\r\\nit\\'s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . \\r\\nthe ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . \\r\\nsome of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the \" fat skinhead , \" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn\\'t as well travelled . \\r\\nfurlong\\'s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn\\'t seem like it has actually arrived there . \\r\\neven derek\\'s descent into skinhead-dom doesn\\'t seem justified . \\r\\nthough his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from \" boy meets world , \" and don\\'t ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . \\r\\nas such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . \\r\\nsorta . \\r\\n \" american history x \" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . \\r\\nsomewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . \\r\\nalthough he aimed for the directing credit to go to \" alan smithee , \" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn\\'t allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that\\'s the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . \\r\\nkaye\\'s right in that it\\'s not up to par , even if he\\'s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . \\r\\nthis will not be a \" do the right thing \" for the late 90s . \\r\\nyet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one\\'s own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . \\r\\nand even if it isn\\'t perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he\\'s done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience . \\r\\n'),\n",

\" \\r\\nastronaut a : \" yeah , that\\'s mars all right . \" \\r\\nastronaut c : \" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? \" \\r\\nthat exchange isn\\'t actually in \" mission to mars , \" but i wouldn\\'t be surprised if it were . \\r\\nfor all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven\\'t learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don\\'t tell . \\r\\nde palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . \\r\\nthis is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won\\'t get what\\'s going on , so they explain everything five times over . \\r\\nfourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . \\r\\nthe principal actors sleepwalk their way through \" mission to mars , \" never managing to do away with an apparent \" i\\'m just here to get a paycheck \" attitude . \\r\\ncheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . \\r\\narmin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . \\r\\nrobbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard \" decent guy \" performance . \\r\\nand sinise hams it up with \" wistful \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . \\r\\nand of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in \" 2001 \" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . \\r\\nit could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy \" mission to mars , \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going . \\r\\nleisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of \" mission to mars \" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . \\r\\nsupposedly we\\'re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of \" armageddon \" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . \\r\\nme , i alternated between the two . \\r\\nthere is only one good thing about the way \" mission to mars \" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over . \\r\\n'),\n",

       " Pandas(Index=682, label='pos', review='note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\r\\nbe forewarned . \\r\\nlike its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent . \\r\\na sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking . \\r\\nthe film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop . \\r\\nas boogie nights opens , he\\'s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity . \\r\\nrecruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar . \\r\\nwholeheartedly embraced by jack\\'s troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his \" one special thing \" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a \" big bright shining star \" . \\r\\nhis lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in . \\r\\nthe element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious . \\r\\nfrom the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson\\'s accomplished command of the camera is without question . \\r\\nwhile novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco\\'s unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent . \\r\\nit\\'s a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker\\'s career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it\\'s somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he\\'s clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he\\'s borrowing from some of the best , and it\\'s entirely effective within the context of this film . \\r\\nwhile boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it\\'s also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour . \\r\\nthe film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded . \\r\\nwhile much of the film\\'s humour pertains to the characters\\' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope\\'s demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get \\'freaky deaky\\' with the music -- it\\'s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous . \\r\\na giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk\\'s bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking . \\r\\nably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson\\'s personal collection ) , there\\'s a clear affection for the era in boogie nights . \\r\\nit\\'s the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film\\'s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters . \\r\\nafter the debacle with 1996\\'s milos forman film , the people vs . \\r\\nlarry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public . \\r\\nhowever , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it\\'s hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there\\'s very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business . \\r\\nthe glimpses on the sets of jack horner\\'s shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there\\'s a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it\\'s refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided . \\r\\nif anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves . \\r\\njack horner\\'s dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) . \\r\\nin both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack\\'s retort of \" there are shadows in light , baby \" to his cinematographer\\'s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood\\'s \" it\\'s not about the little details , it\\'s about the big picture ! \" \\r\\nrant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false . \\r\\nin boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers\\' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there\\'s nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an \\'artistic\\' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark . \\r\\nmuch like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes \" this is the best work i\\'ve ever done \" , it\\'s genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness . \\r\\nmr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter . \\r\\nwhile boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn\\'t any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film\\'s characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film\\'s * protagonist * literally doesn\\'t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it\\'s no wonder why the playfully inane \" how much can you bench ? \" \\r\\nbanter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film\\'s finest exchanges . \\r\\nand while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it\\'s problematic that some of the the threads given to the film\\'s characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore\\'s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character\\'s story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions . \\r\\nstill , even if he doesn\\'t always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same . \\r\\nin any case , it\\'s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it\\'s a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger\\'s \" sister christian \" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard . \\r\\nif this scene already wasn\\'t tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness . \\r\\nthere are some other interesting touches in boogie nights . \\r\\nmr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect . \\r\\nsimilarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver\\'s seat , sobbing \" i\\'m so stupid \" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver\\'s seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening . \\r\\nboogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good . \\r\\nwhile most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention . \\r\\nmr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard\\'s georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film . \\r\\ni\\'m not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee . \\r\\nmr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it\\'s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation . \\r\\nworth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track \" you got the touch \" in a vain attempt at a musical career . \\r\\nmr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective . \\r\\nms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry . \\r\\nconsequently , it\\'s a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she\\'s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp . \\r\\nher role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she\\'s essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity . \\r\\n ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) \\r\\nand a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham\\'s parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant\\'s drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet . \\r\\ndraw your own conclusions . \\r\\nperhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion . \\r\\nhis relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it\\'s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry . \\r\\nwhile the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle\\'s eyes makes the scene unforgettable . \\r\\nluis guzman\\'s most famous work is possibly in brian de palma\\'s carlito\\'s way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who\\'s a hanger-on to jack\\'s group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures . \\r\\njack\\'s eventual acquiescence to maurice\\'s request leads to one of boogie nights\\' biggest comic payoffs . \\r\\nboogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his

it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on . \\r\\nedward norton , as flynt's straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs . \\r\\nlarry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film . \\r\\none can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges . \\r\\nmilos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic . \\r\\nthere's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining . \\r\\ntwo minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs . \\r\\nlarry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech . \\r\\nconsequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion . \\r\\nit also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level . \\r\\nfor example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter's sister ) to be born-again is a mystery to me . \\r\\nthen again , perhaps it was to him as well . \\r\\nthese two points don't detract greatly from the film . \\r\\nthe people vs . \\r\\nlarry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story . \\r\\n\"),\n",

these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . \\r\\nexcept for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . \\r\\nthe reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . \\r\\nwe\\'re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . \\r\\nmatt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . \\r\\ned norton\\'s worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they\\'re worth . \\r\\njohn turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . \\r\\nhe\\'s both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro\\'s low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich\\'s heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . \\r\\nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike\\'s law professors , abe petrovsky . \\r\\nwhile landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one\\'s self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . \\r\\nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn\\'t seem to have much presence on screen . \\r\\nshe\\'s a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn\\'t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon\\'s reactions instead . \\r\\na good thing about rounders is that it doesn\\'t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can\\'t find time for humor . \\r\\nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . \\r\\none game in a cigar club had me in stitches . \\r\\n \" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , \" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . \\r\\ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . \\r\\nwith all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . \\r\\nyou might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . \\r\\nluckily , we\\'re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what\\'s going on . \\r\\nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . \\r\\nit\\'s nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . \\r\\nas a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . \\r\\nwait ! \\r\\nas a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . \\r\\nhang on ! \\r\\npacked with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . \\r\\nokay , i guess that\\'s enough . \\r\\noh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol\\' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein\\'s mother . \\r\\n'),\n",

rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine . \\r\\ncertainly , the experience wasn\\'t truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , \" i\\'m not going to tell the story the way it happened . . . i\\'ll \\r\\ngonna tell it the way i remember it . \" \\r\\nanyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it\\'s trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations . \\r\\ninstead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult ) . \\r\\nfinn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs . joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper ) . \\r\\nthe setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s . \\r\\nfinn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects ) . \\r\\nduring one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro ) . \\r\\nborrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro\\'s criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor . \\r\\nok . . . maybe \\r\\nthat\\'s an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of

, just to show that he\\'s a really swell guy . \\r\\nand then the plot moves on . \\r\\nenter miss havisham . . . or \\r\\nms . dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft ) . \\r\\nabandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms . dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid . \\r\\nwith bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role . \\r\\nalthough she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film . \\r\\njoe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms . dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult ) . \\r\\nfor no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella . \\r\\nperhaps it\\'s her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before . \\r\\nin any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn\\'t exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her . \\r\\neven when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there\\'s nothing . \\r\\nin fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear\\'s gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets . \\r\\nat this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella\\'s character , and couldn\\'t care less about the two characters . \\r\\nthe bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow . \\r\\nshe fails to imbue estella , a remote character in the book , with even the vaguest traces of humanity . \\r\\nthere\\'s obviously something wrong when , watching the film , you\\'re more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character . \\r\\nwithout a strong estella , finn\\'s obsession seems baseless . \\r\\nyou wish he would just stop whining , let estella marry his rival , walter plane ( an oddly subdued hank azaria ) , and just get on with his life . \\r\\nin fact , the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot . \\r\\nfinn\\'s relationship with his brother-in-law , joe , is interesting , if a bit stereotypical . \\r\\nwhat\\'s more fascinating are his interactions with deniro . \\r\\nalthough it\\'s only a bit part , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create . \\r\\nit is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film . \\r\\nsome of the shots work , but others are too obviously staged ( for example , both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact . \\r\\nfinn\\'s art ( actually the creations of italian painter , francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect . \\r\\nwe never see why finn would generate this style of art , which is simultaneously crude and insightful . \\r\\nas a result , it ends up as distant as the rest of the film . \\r\\nmodernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see william shakespeare\\'s romeo+juliet ) . \\r\\nsimply update the action to a modern setting , and apply plenty of modern rock .

\\r\\nfor shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners . \\r\\ndoes this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? \\r\\nthe answer to that question is not a very easy one , either . \\r\\nas far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable . \\r\\nit wasn\\'t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached . \\r\\nfor unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before . \\r\\nthe story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan\\'s direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving . \\r\\nthere are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis\\' character and another train passenger . \\r\\nthe shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak . \\r\\nalso very impressive is the film\\'s score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan\\'s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year\\'s dinosaur ) . \\r\\nseveral of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film . \\r\\none of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to \" exercise \" his powers . \\r\\nthe music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie . \\r\\nif there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it . \\r\\nthe film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment . \\r\\nwillis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can\\'t seem to figure out why he\\'s been depressed for the last few years . \\r\\nhis character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah\\'s tutelage . \\r\\njackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . \\r\\nthough his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked . \\r\\nrobin wright penn\\'s role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character\\'s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again . \\r\\nspencer treat clark , as the dunne\\'s young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film . \\r\\nout of all the characters , jeremy\\'s is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role . \\r\\nwhere the film does lose points though , is during its \" surprise \" ending . \\r\\nshyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying \" that was it ? ! \" \\r\\nwhen unbreakable revealed its own ending . \\r\\nit\\'s not that the ending is bad , it\\'s just that the ending doesn\\'t quite have the emotional punch that the other film\\'s did . \\r\\nplus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won\\'t reveal the ending here , but you\\'ll understand what i mean when you see it ) . \\r\\nessentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable . \\r\\nthe only real problem is that the ending doesn\\'t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . \\r\\nas long as it isn\\'t held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . \\r\\none thing seems clear , though . \\r\\nshyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film . \\r\\n'),\n",

it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military/cia . \\r\\nthe disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro . \\r\\nthe missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army/navy/air force want to flex their might and invade cuba , while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america\\'s dignity and world leadership intact . \\r\\nwhile the internal battle for power rages in the white house , with air force chief curtis lemay ( kevin conway ) advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age , our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba . \\r\\nthis is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action . \\r\\nwhen the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter , the tension is palpable . \\r\\nthe most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti-aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane . \\r\\nthis is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least , making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles . \\r\\nthe ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players . \\r\\ngreenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk , foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent . \\r\\ninstead , he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office , directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options . \\r\\nkennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president . \\r\\ncostner , as ken o\\'donnell , is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor . \\r\\ncostner plays o\\'donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech . \\r\\nthe rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy . \\r\\nthe rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast , too . \\r\\nstanding out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un , adlai stevenson , who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly . \\r\\nthe filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy , using old style video footage to good effect . \\r\\ndylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara . \\r\\nkevin conway gives his general lemay the right \" bomb them to hell \" attitude . \\r\\nalso notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who , with his wingman , takes on the dangerous mission of a low-level photo recon into the heart of cuba , bravely challenging kenny o\\'donnell\\'s admonition , \" don\\' get shot . \" \\r\\ntech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing . \\r\\nit\\'s an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event . \\r\\nsolid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys . \\r\\nthere is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right . \\r\\nthe special f/x of the u2 sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging . \\r\\nthe cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader . \\r\\nhelmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year . \\r\\ni give \" thirteen days \" an a- . \\r\\n'),\n",

) , is good enough to make you forget you\\'re watching a cartoon . \\r\\nthe giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . \\r\\nthe characters\\' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . \\r\\nfine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . \\r\\nharry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv\\'s \" frasier \" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . \\r\\nunlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn\\'t ditched ) . \\r\\ndean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . \\r\\neven the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . \\r\\na lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won\\'t mind , but \" the iron giant \" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . \\r\\nthe film isn\\'t only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . \\r\\nit\\'s also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . \\r\\nthe scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on \" the simpsons \" for many years . \\r\\na sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to \" outlast \" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . \\r\\nthe film even takes some jabs at america\\'s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to \" duck and cover \" in the event of a nuclear attack . \\r\\n \" the iron giant \" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . \\r\\ninstead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . \\r\\nwhen you get right down to it , \" the iron giant \" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . \\r\\nthe story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . \\r\\nthough i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . \\r\\nit\\'s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it\\'s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which \" the iron giant \" has in spades . \\r\\n'),\n",
       " Pandas(Index=743, label='pos', review='note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\r\\nbe forewarned . \\r\\nthe teaser trailers for my best friend\\'s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i\\'d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . \\r\\nit was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend\\'s wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . \\r\\nthe heroine of my best friend\\'s wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o\\'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn\\'t married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . \\r\\nboth julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael\\'s age , julianne realizes that he\\'s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . \\r\\nhowever , she finds herself even more distraught when michael\\'s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . \\r\\nthe setup for my best friend\\'s wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film\\'s storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel\\'s wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend\\'s wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . \\r\\nthe film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . \\r\\nfor example , there\\'s a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . \\r\\nmy best friend\\'s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen\\'s everyone says i love you ; i\\'d even assert it\\'s a more successful one . \\r\\nmy best friend\\'s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . \\r\\nin a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy\\'s life , she\\'d actually like her too . \\r\\nthe george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend\\'s wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . \\r\\nthroughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . \\r\\nthere is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we\\'re given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . \\r\\nmy best friend\\'s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . \\r\\nthis isn\\'t the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character\\'s neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . \\r\\neven better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend\\'s weddding . \\r\\nwith a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy\\'s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . \\r\\nshe even sings - i won\\'t soon forget her charming serenade of \" i just don\\'t know what to do with myself \" . \\r\\nrupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . \\r\\nhis george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett\\'s performance is a delight to watch ; he\\'s clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . \\r\\ndermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he\\'s not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . \\r\\nwhen julia roberts\\' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as \" america\\'s sweetheart \" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . \\r\\nwhile that didn\\'t quite work out , it\\'s near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . \\r\\nmy best friend\\'s wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan\\'s reputation as a skilled director of comedy . \\r\\n'),\n",

it\\'s just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of \" thirtysomething \" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . \\r\\nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . \\r\\nthe movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . \\r\\nin one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . \\r\\neach man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . \\r\\na couple of the movie\\'s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . \\r\\nthe regiment\\'s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . \\r\\nlike any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north\\'s victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\' \\r\\nby the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed . \\r\\ngeorge lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster . \\r\\nthe phantom menace is no star wars film . \\r\\ntake away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you\\'re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time . \\r\\nit\\'s an embarrassment . \\r\\ni looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn\\'t used . \\r\\nthere are a few of each , but they\\'re all token attempts . \\r\\nthe fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects . \\r\\nthis is not what i wanted to see . \\r\\ni didn\\'t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did . \\r\\nthe story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo . \\r\\nnaboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people . \\r\\nafter picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) . \\r\\nqui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys . \\r\\nthe bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters . \\r\\nthere isn\\'t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form . \\r\\nthe way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory . \\r\\nfirst of all , we don\\'t learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn . \\r\\nnot one thing . \\r\\nwhat was his life like before this film ? \\r\\nwell , i imagine he didn\\'t have one . \\r\\nthat\\'s why he feels like a plot device . \\r\\nthis probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he\\'s recently retired from film ( i don\\'t blame him , honestly ) . \\r\\nobi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . \\r\\nmcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . \\r\\nsince these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . \\r\\nthings start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . \\r\\ni was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . \\r\\nand when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . \\r\\nalso fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written . \\r\\njar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i\\'ve ever had to endure , but he\\'s more interesting than most of the humans . \\r\\nas soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it\\'s back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . \\r\\ni\\'ve seen many movies that qualify as \" special effects extravaganzas , \" but the phantom menace is the first one i\\'ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . \\r\\nthe reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint . \\r\\ni can\\'t say that i didn\\'t find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . \\r\\nbut i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . \\r\\nmy breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . \\r\\ncan\\'t we have one stinking scene that isn\\'t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? \\r\\ni got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . \\r\\nand then there\\'s the question of magic . \\r\\nwhat was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? \\r\\ni have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . \\r\\njohn williams\\' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas\\' direction . \\r\\ni think it comes right down to characters : there are none here . \\r\\ni longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . \\r\\nand what about the ridiculous expectations ? \\r\\nmine weren\\'t that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects . \\r\\ninstead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show . \\r\\ni don\\'t hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i\\'d like to forget that it exists , and yet i can\\'t . \\r\\nit\\'s here to stay . \\r\\ni can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don\\'t , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series . \\r\\n'),\n",

washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm\\'s length . \\r\\nwe feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . \\r\\nwashington\\'s is a performance of weight and emotional depth . \\r\\nhe doesn\\'t merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . \\r\\nhis work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . \\r\\nnorman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . \\r\\n \" the hurricane \" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . \\r\\njewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ;

everyone else is a stereotype . \\r\\nthe canadians are good . \\r\\nthe cops are bad . \\r\\nthe canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film\\'s failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya\\'s ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . \\r\\nmuch of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( \" hate put me in prison . \\r\\nlove\\'s gonna bust me out . \" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special . \\r\\nit\\'s too bad . \\r\\nthe cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . \\r\\ni wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than \" he\\'s a racist pig . \" \\r\\ni wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . \\r\\nin short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . \\r\\ncriticism has been levied against the liberties \" the hurricane \" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . \\r\\nfor example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . \\r\\nmost accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . \\r\\nfurthermore , much of carter\\'s criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . \\r\\nof course , \" the hurricane \" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don\\'t remove one fact : \" the hurricane \" is a highly flawed film . \\r\\nonly one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it\\'s a good thing \" the hurricane \" has that actor . \\r\\ncarter has been quoted as saying , \" denzel washington is making me look good , \" but he\\'s not the only one . \\r\\nwashington makes this film look good . \\r\\ndenzel washington\\'s \" the hurricane . \" \\r\\nsounds pretty good to me . \\r\\n'),\n",

monster dino hit , many critics described schindler\\'s list as the director\\'s \" penance \" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) . \\r\\nnow , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance . \\r\\nonce again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers . \\r\\nnow , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity . \\r\\nthat film is amistad . \\r\\nalthough not as masterful as schindler\\'s list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture . \\r\\nthematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact . \\r\\nwatching schindler\\'s list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience . \\r\\nspielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later . \\r\\naspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since . \\r\\namistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent . \\r\\nthe incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that\\'s not a surprise . \\r\\nhowever , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order . \\r\\nseveral , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film\\'s dramatic force . \\r\\non the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired . \\r\\none stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape . \\r\\nled by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew . \\r\\nadrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey . \\r\\nthey are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states\\' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut . \\r\\nthe kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy . \\r\\nthe first men to come to the africans\\' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) . \\r\\nthey are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute . \\r\\naided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge . \\r\\nbut powerful forces have aligned against baldwin\\'s cause . \\r\\ncurrent president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free . \\r\\nat its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage . \\r\\ncinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to . \\r\\nhe is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up . \\r\\neffectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies . \\r\\nthey are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie\\'s success . \\r\\nto amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans\\' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man\\'s seemingly-strange \" rituals \" . \\r\\nthe larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity . \\r\\nas the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as \" sub-human , \" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense . \\r\\nthe abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property . \\r\\nin a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything . \\r\\namistad\\'s presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history . \\r\\nfour claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them . \\r\\nbaldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque . \\r\\neven though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate . \\r\\naside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch . \\r\\nmatthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his \" pretty boy \" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case . \\r\\nlikewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than \" abolitionists . \" \\r\\nnigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election . \\r\\nfinally , there\\'s anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done . \\r\\nhopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams . \\r\\nhis ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable . \\r\\none point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler\\'s list is this film\\'s lack of a well-defined human villain . \\r\\nschindler\\'s list had ralph fiennes\\' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . \\r\\nthere is no such figure in amistad . \\r\\nthe villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary . \\r\\nit is to spielberg\\'s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist . \\r\\namistad\\'s trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident . \\r\\nan opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 . \\r\\nnumerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves . \\r\\nit remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg\\'s rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history . \\r\\n'),\n",
       " Pandas(Index=771, label='pos', review='true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it . \\r\\neven the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms . \\r\\nso it\\'s not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get \" the apostle \" onto the big-screen . \\r\\nas a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money . \\r\\nhe also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss \" sonny \" dewey . \\r\\nfew filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it\\'s testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall . \\r\\nand , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion . \\r\\nsonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve . \\r\\nhe spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals . \\r\\nunlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film\\'s purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church . \\r\\nduvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses . \\r\\none of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher . \\r\\nfaced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper . \\r\\nat his son\\'s baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife\\'s lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal . \\r\\nnot knowing what else to do , sonny disappears . \\r\\nhe throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again . \\r\\nin the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling . \\r\\nafter befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town\\'s ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple . \\r\\nre-christening himself as \" the apostle e . f . , \" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other\\'s lives . \\r\\nbut , always , sonny\\'s past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress . \\r\\nduvall has made his intentions in making \" the apostle \" clear . \\r\\nin a recent article in \" newsweek , \" he wrote : \" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers . . . \\r\\nbut what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . \" \\r\\nthe strength of duvall\\'s convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - \" the apostle \" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he\\'s being sincere with the subject matter . \\r\\nafter fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual . \\r\\nhis sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to . \\r\\n \" i\\'ve always called you jesus and you\\'ve always called me sonny , \" he says . \\r\\nwhen neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny\\'s mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there\\'s no sense trying to interrupt him . \\r\\nthe main theme to emerge from \" the apostle \" is the fact that good can come from any situation . \\r\\nsonny\\'s act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact . \\r\\nhowever , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him . \\r\\nin his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him . \\r\\nand , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment . \\r\\nit is that strength in sonny\\'s character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others -

) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \\r\\nand so it goes . \\r\\nand the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong\\'s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i\\'ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \\r\\nlet\\'s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \\r\\naction . \\r\\nthere\\'s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \\r\\ncourse , in a kung fu film , that\\'s to be expected . \\r\\nhowever , this isn\\'t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \\r\\nthe primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \\r\\nfurther , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \\r\\nthere\\'s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \\r\\nunder normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \\r\\nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i\\'ll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \\r\\nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \\r\\neven without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \\r\\namong other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \\r\\n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \\r\\nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \\r\\ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . \\r\\nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \\r\\nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\\'s father\\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \\r\\njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \\r\\nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \\r\\nit\\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \\r\\nthe picture is crisp and clear . \\r\\none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \\r\\n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \\r\\nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \\r\\ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it\\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \\r\\nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\\'s to be expected in this type of film . \\r\\nif you like this kind of movie , you\\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \\r\\nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \\r\\n'),\n",

elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants . \\r\\nthe maid narrates what

discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them . \\r\\nadapted from elliott\\'s memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer\\'s latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history . \\r\\nresisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . \\r\\ngrace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along . \\r\\na foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace\\'s life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king\\'s hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus ) . \\r\\nthe times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence . \\r\\nduring the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke\\'s sister-in-law on a stake . \\r\\nrohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob . \\r\\nin doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death . \\r\\nwhen grace sees her friend\\'s disembodied head on a pole , rohmer\\'s attention drifts from the societal change to one woman\\'s reaction shot , laden with hot tears . \\r\\ngrace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob . \\r\\nthrough her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist\\'s escape . \\r\\ngrace doesn\\'t even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) . \\r\\nshe endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence . \\r\\nmaintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance . \\r\\nthe events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values . \\r\\naristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones . \\r\\nthe duke is called to vote on the king\\'s punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) . \\r\\nthe episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification . \\r\\nlazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke . \\r\\nthat\\'s foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer\\'s characters occasionally become didactic . \\r\\nrohmer\\'s imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future . \\r\\nwhat may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer\\'s use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism . \\r\\nthe actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris . \\r\\nthis recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide-open streets . \\r\\nit looks as

the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times . \\r\\nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . \\r\\nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . \\r\\nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence . \\r\\nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain . \\r\\nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . \\r\\nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against \" scum \" is something that average person wants , but doesn\\'t have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . \\r\\nwhile de niro\\'s travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel . \\r\\nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america\\'s better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he \" knows stuff \" . \\r\\nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade . \\r\\nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . \\r\\nmatthew \" sport \" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ;

his broad and senseless \" messages \" that cover the lack of any serious program can\\'t fool even such idiots like travis . \\r\\nthe past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can\\'t be washed away even by ironic happy end . \\r\\ntravis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader\\'s screenplay into the silver screen . \\r\\nnew york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere . \\r\\nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture . \\r\\none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason . \\r\\ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie . \\r\\nnow , more than two decades later , when some other \" life imitating art \" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory . \\r\\n'),\n",

transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you\\'re of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up . \\r\\nthe story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him . \\r\\nall his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) . \\r\\nthe eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father\\'s home . \\r\\nhis brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable . \\r\\nwe then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who

, the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film\\'s punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age . \\r\\nbut since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it\\'s all terribly interesting to watch . \\r\\ntwists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends . \\r\\nthe most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion . \\r\\nas a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose \" the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical

\\r\\nwe see key moments in people\\'s lives that they wouldn\\'t dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film . \\r\\nthe key , though , to this film , and the reason it\\'s not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth . \\r\\nthroughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water . \\r\\nof course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn\\'t have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them . \\r\\nand yes , it\\'s thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier . \\r\\nbut then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he\\'s done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface . \\r\\nthe final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex . \\r\\neveryone else is

' \\r\\nsprinkled throughout the screenplay . \\r\\ni was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . \\r\\nthere's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . \\r\\nit seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does . \\r\\nthe musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . \\r\\nif it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . \\r\\nbut the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . \\r\\nduring these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . \\r\\nit's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . \\r\\n`the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf . \\r\\nanyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film . \\r\\ndespite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy . \\r\\n\"),\n",

\\r\\nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they\\'re parodying that \\'blair witch\\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \\r\\nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \\r\\nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn\\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \\r\\nif you\\'ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \\r\\neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \\r\\npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\\'s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \\r\\nenjoyment of this movie doesn\\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\\'ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \\r\\nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \\r\\nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \\r\\nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \\r\\nthe characters\\' inevitable romance doesn\\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \\r\\npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\\'t any help . \\r\\njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \\r\\nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \\r\\none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \\r\\nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \\r\\nthe animation is first-rate . \\r\\nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \\r\\nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \\r\\nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug\\'s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \\r\\ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\\'ll catch all the details . \\r\\nanyway , the movie\\'s just a boatload of fun . \\r\\nfunnest damn movie i\\'ve seen all year . \\r\\n'),\n",
       " Pandas(Index=824, label='pos', review='in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well . \\r\\ntaken as a whole , there\\'s little that\\'s special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us . \\r\\nbut it\\'s intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted . \\r\\nso , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it\\'s a worthwhile sample of entertainment . \\r\\nlike scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man . \\r\\nthe formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . \\r\\nal pacino\\'s slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams\\' sean mcguire is much more subtle . \\r\\nand matt damon\\'s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o\\'donnell\\'s charlie . \\r\\nwill is a troubled individual . \\r\\nas a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse . \\r\\nan orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis . \\r\\nnow , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet . \\r\\nhe has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box . \\r\\nbut he\\'s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems . \\r\\nwhile working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building\\'s hall blackboards . \\r\\nthen , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work . \\r\\nwill flees , but lambeau tracks him down . \\r\\nunfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer . \\r\\nthe judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist . \\r\\neventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case . \\r\\nafter a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor . \\r\\nand , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) . \\r\\nthe script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . \\r\\nthe characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . \\r\\nat one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a \" taster\\'s choice moment . \" \\r\\nlater , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith . \\r\\n ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it\\'s not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) \\r\\ndirector gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . \\r\\nthere\\'s an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric . \\r\\nlikewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie\\'s friendship . \\r\\nmany of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . \\r\\nmatt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . \\r\\nminnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it\\'s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . \\r\\nthe outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . \\r\\narguably the best dramatic work in the actor\\'s career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams\\' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . \\r\\nadequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . \\r\\nlike most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . \\r\\nbut meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren\\'t always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . \\r\\ngood will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the \" good \" in the title . \\r\\n'),\n",

) . \\r\\nas if that weren\\'t enough , ellie\\'s discovery leads her to the nation\\'s capital where she again runs into palmer . \\r\\ncontact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . \\r\\nthe impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . \\r\\narguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . \\r\\nwhen palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . \\r\\nthe question is , can a person who doesn\\'t believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? \\r\\neven when the film wraps up , it\\'s uncertain whether it\\'s meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where \" right and wrong \" is only opinion ( at least speaking \" politically correctly \" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . \\r\\ndon\\'t get me wrong . \\r\\nas much as it sounds like it , contact isn\\'t merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . \\r\\nit\\'s a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . \\r\\ndespite its seemingly heavy issues , it\\'s not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . \\r\\nthe special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) \\r\\nhighly depreciated on the small screen . \\r\\neven so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as \" sci-fi \" . \\r\\nthe storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it\\'s easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i\\'ve ever seen . \\r\\nthis is zemeckis\\' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast . \\r\\n'),\n",

       " Pandas(Index=839, label='neg', review='a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \\r\\nfirst , there\\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \\r\\nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \\r\\nno no . . . \\r\\njust kidding . \\r\\nhad you going there for a moment , didn\\'t i ? \\r\\nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \\r\\nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \\r\\nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \\r\\nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \\r\\nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \\r\\ni\\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \\r\\nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\\'t try to overachieve . \\r\\nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \\r\\nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \\r\\nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \\r\\nshao khan has decided that he\\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \\r\\nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \\r\\none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \\r\\ntoo bad they didn\\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \\r\\ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \\r\\n * the acting is truly bad . \\r\\nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \\r\\n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \\r\\nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \\r\\ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he\\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \\r\\n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \\r\\n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \\r\\nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \\r\\n . . . unless you\\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \\r\\nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \\r\\n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \\r\\nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \\r\\nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \\r\\n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \\r\\nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \\r\\na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \\r\\n * there aren\\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \\r\\nsilly , silly folks . \\r\\nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \\r\\nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \\r\\n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \\r\\nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \\r\\nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . \\r\\nyou\\'ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\' \\r\\n- see , that\\'s provocative , leaves room for further questions . \" ) \\r\\nthe film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene , a session of nude bowling , the policeman joining in on terry and nick\\'s acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes . \\r\\nthis occurs particularly often during the film\\'s opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital , i\\'m realising that this is * intended * to be funny , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it\\'s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick\\'s scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes . \\r\\nthe entire sequence is , then , clearly an exercise for character exposition , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability . \\r\\namong the cast , coming off best is david arquette , the current master in the portrayal of meek , squirming , stammering fresh-faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang\\'s swimming with sharks - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry . \\r\\nmr . taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique , where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated , as opposed to a bright , crisp look for the smalltown scenes . \\r\\nthe charge of dream with the fishes\\'s protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters , and indeed , in many cases have i been in the minority , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult , audience-unfriendly nature of their characters . \\r\\nfor dream with the fishes , though , i did find myself on the flip side of coin , often hoping that the film would quickly conclude , and that the nick character would just hurry up and die . \\r\\n'),\n",

indeed . \\r\\nand whereas \" babe : pig in the city \" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece . \\r\\nmore than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right . \\r\\n \" babe : pig in the city \" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like \" the godfather :

to say the familiar is absent . \\r\\n \" babe : pig in the city \" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film . \\r\\nalong with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs . hoggett ( one of this decade\\'s best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski ) . \\r\\nthe three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals . \\r\\nthe story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice . \\r\\nfrom there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne\\'s soothingly deep narrative . \\r\\ncomposer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these . \\r\\nbut these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting . \\r\\nwhile staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals . \\r\\nmonkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new \" urbanites \" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter . \\r\\neach character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching . \\r\\nand while this world focuses

put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level . \\r\\nrestricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture . \\r\\nbut the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world\\'s architectural landmarks . \\r\\ndesigning a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) . \\r\\nadded to that , many of this city\\'s streets are the twin siblings of venice\\'s gondola-trekked rivers . \\r\\nthe metropolis that has sprung from ford\\'s vision is a wondrous sight to behold . \\r\\nit is a world that you want to walk around in . \\r\\nnorma moriceau\\'s costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford\\'s landscape . \\r\\nmost of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom\\'s clown outfit . \\r\\nandrew lesnie\\'s photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film\\'s multiple emotional tones . \\r\\nmuch press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of \" babe : pig in the city \" . \\r\\nreports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating . \\r\\nthese reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating . \\r\\nbut even so , to be anything harsher than the original\\' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms . \\r\\nby deleting a minimal number of shots , \" babe : pig in the city \" was eventually given the coveted g rating . \\r\\nalthough appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself . \\r\\nwell , to coin a phrase , the reports of \" babe : pig in the city \" \\'s death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated . \\r\\ngranted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all \" babe : pig in the city \" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be . \\r\\nwhatever \" dark \" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the \" mad max \" trilogy , \" the witches of eastwick \" , \" lorenzo\\'s oil \" ) . \\r\\nhaving served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director\\'s chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise . \\r\\nthe story of \" babe : pig in the city \" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn\\'t achieve the emotional or character depth of the original . \\r\\nmissing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual\\'s worth , challenging conformity , and one\\'s purpose in life . \\r\\n \" babe \" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless

parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on . \\r\\nbut this film\\'s goals aren\\'t as lofty as the first\\'s , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive . \\r\\n \" babe : pig in the city \" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe . \\r\\nhoggett\\'s love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality . \\r\\nbest exemplified in hoggett\\'s dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique . \\r\\nit is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not . \\r\\nplease understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se\\' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between \" babe : pig in the city \" being a very good film and the original being a great one . \\r\\nbut having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best . \\r\\nas an overall piece , \" babe : pig in the city \" is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end . \\r\\nsure , it isn\\'t a great film , but it is an excellent one

\\r\\ni somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn\\'t attempting to be the utter farce which it is . \\r\\narnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be . \\r\\nmr . schwarzenegger\\'s attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable . \\r\\nby the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen . \\r\\nthe bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of \" cool ! \" \\r\\nin the least inventive way . \\r\\ngeorge clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film . \\r\\nhis batman is hardly an imposing figure . \\r\\nchris o\\'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all . \\r\\nthe film\\'s one saving grace ?

\\r\\nis brilliant . \\r\\nmars attacks ! \\r\\nis based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer\\'s independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas . \\r\\nbut unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! \\r\\nhas a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it . \\r\\nthe big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! \\r\\nportrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are . \\r\\nthe title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation . \\r\\nthe spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman\\'s thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping . \\r\\nit\\'s so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing . \\r\\nthe movie lays low for the next 40 minutes . \\r\\nwe get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming . \\r\\nbut mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . \\r\\nit\\'s a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton\\'s just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . \\r\\nanyone who comes to mars attacks !

but a perfectly plausible one , the panorama in which breakdown musters it's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness . \\r\\nit is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays , but breakdown doesn't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it's finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption . \\r\\nthe plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988's the vanishing . \\r\\nkurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job . \\r\\nwhen they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest , jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver , who later , will be an important player in the plot department .

informs jeff where to search for his wife , a town about twenty miles from here . \\r\\nthere , trouble arises . \\r\\nand i shall not reveal anything else , since that would be spoiling the fun of what's head . \\r\\nthere are many involving , tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck , will have you feeling as

the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn't overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses . \\r\\nso you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect . \\r\\nsuffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one . \\r\\nnot many well-paid actors can deliver these type of performances , but russell is one of them . \\r\\nas an everyday man , he pulls it off extremely convincingly , what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes . \\r\\nalthough the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with . \\r\\nfaced with an enigma about his wife's whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is . \\r\\nwhat's most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow . \\r\\nmostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair . \\r\\ncontrary to most american thrillers , he doesn't rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance . \\r\\nafter breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety . \\r\\nthe villains in the movie aren't your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective . \\r\\nthe baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder . \\r\\nthe movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today's movies . \\r\\nworth a special mentioning is j . t walsh ( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision ) as the leader of the gang , he renders a deliciously wicked performance , temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for . \\r\\nalfred hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate , but as a way of aiding his audience's fascination in his stories , which were slowly realizing man's biggest fears . \\r\\nbreakdown yields exactly that . \\r\\nit magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man , acting like an ordinary man , looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero . \\r\\ndespite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock , i think , would approve of breakdown . \\r\\n ( 1 : 33 ) \\r\\n\"),\n",

       " Pandas(Index=865, label='pos', review='mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) \\r\\nwith three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest \" hot properties \" in action adventure stardom , and it\\'s just about time . \\r\\nfor over twenty-five years , jackie\\'s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . \\r\\n \" drunken master \" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to \" make it big \" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . \\r\\ni\\'m not entirely sure why , exactly . \\r\\nin many ways , \" drunken master \" is similar to most of jackie\\'s other early films , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii , \" master with cracked fingers \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , \" spiritual kung fu \" , and others . \\r\\nin fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . \\r\\nto be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . \\r\\nthey\\'re quite different from action movies as we know them in america . \\r\\nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \\r\\n \" drunken master \" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . \\r\\n ( as an aside , \" drunken master \" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in \\r\\na movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . \\r\\nat the time , i didn\\'t really think it was anything special . . . but \\r\\nafter having seen more films like it , it\\'s kind of grown on me . ) \\r\\n \" drunken master \" \\'s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii and \" master with cracked fingers \" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been \" adapted , \" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . \\r\\nmore specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka \" naughty panther , \" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . \\r\\nafter embarrassing his instructor\\'s assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and \\r\\nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . \\r\\nhis father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . \\r\\nkei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . \\r\\nwhile escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . \\r\\nthis turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . \\r\\nhe assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . \\r\\nthen , when he\\'s ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . \\r\\nunfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . \\r\\n \" drunken master \" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . \\r\\nit\\'s been said before , but i\\'ll say it again--these fights don\\'t just _happen_ , they\\'re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . \\r\\nin his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . \\r\\nthe fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . \\r\\nwhether jackie wins or loses , it\\'s really something to see . . . and \\r\\nit\\'s often as funny as anything , too . \\r\\nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . \\r\\nthere\\'s very little that\\'s new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \\r\\nschticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \\r\\nbut they\\'re still hilarious as ever . \\r\\nlikewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they\\'re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \\r\\nthe really big thing about \" drunken master \" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \\r\\ni\\'m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \\r\\nit apparently helps if you\\'re drunk while you\\'re doing it . \\r\\ngenuine or not , i have to admit , there\\'s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what\\'s going on . \\r\\ncome to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film\\'s success over any of the other jackie films . . . it\\'s \\r\\nnot just martial arts , it\\'s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , \" whoa . . . \" \\r\\non the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \\r\\n \" gone with the wind \" , this isn\\'t . \\r\\nstill , if you like martial arts films , or like what you\\'ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \\r\\nit\\'s much more \" real \" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \\r\\nyou might very well like it . \\r\\nanother interesting thing about \" drunken master \" has to do with its video availability in the us . \\r\\n \" drunken master \" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \\r\\nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \\r\\nthankfully , \" drunken master \" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \\r\\nif you like \" drunken master \" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren\\'t really _too_ bad . . . if \\r\\nnothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \\r\\ni particularly recommend \" spiritual kung fu \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , the \" fearless hyena \" movies , and \" snake & crane arts of shaolin \" . \\r\\nalso , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , \" drunken master ii \" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \\r\\nalso , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i\\'ve been

\\r\\nby itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film . \\r\\nhowever , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think . \\r\\njackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she\\'s also making a deal with the feds as well as with max . \\r\\nthe film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around . \\r\\ninstead , it\\'s actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today\\'s movies . \\r\\nat least this film has a little imagination . \\r\\nmost of the performances in jackie brown are above par . \\r\\npam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable . \\r\\nsamuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control . \\r\\nrobert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . . \\r\\nnever mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy\\'s apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course . \\r\\nhe\\'s just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn\\'t occur to us , even when we\\'re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade . \\r\\nin supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell\\'s , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town . \\r\\nunfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences . \\r\\nin this film , he\\'s not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , \" little bit , \" and \" pretty much . \" \\r\\nfonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side . \\r\\nas is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy . \\r\\nit grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves . \\r\\ndon\\'t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however . \\r\\nthere\\'s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he\\'s not really sure what\\'s happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what\\'s going on is felt simultaneously by the audience . \\r\\nwe look at the screen and think , \" gee , that\\'s clever , \" and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on . \\r\\nalthough tarantino isn\\'t afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film . \\r\\nthere are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head . \\r\\nthis is a tribute to both direction and acting . \\r\\nhowever , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something . \\r\\nwe get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she\\'s looking for , but instead hoping she\\'ll just stop . \\r\\noverall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well . \\r\\nsome flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it\\'s really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today . \\r\\nin fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these \" offensive \" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness . \\r\\ngo see the film and see what i mean . \\r\\n'),\n",

the fact that he\\'s an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . \\r\\npullman\\'s performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he\\'s going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . \\r\\nben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he\\'s the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . \\r\\n \" i\\'ll shoot you , \" he says to stark at one point . \\r\\n \" i have a gun , and everything . \" \\r\\nhis character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . \\r\\no\\'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . \\r\\ni find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . \\r\\nkasdan\\'s humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . \\r\\nit\\'s the kind of humor that\\'s funny even after you\\'ve seen it five or six times . \\r\\nthere\\'s one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . \\r\\nwhat we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . \\r\\ni can\\'t convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . \\r\\nas a side note , i don\\'t consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . \\r\\nthere was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . \\r\\ni have a feeling the humor here won\\'t appeal to everyone , but there\\'s certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone\\'s interest . \\r\\njake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . \\r\\ni found this out after seeing the film , and i can\\'t remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . \\r\\nhis direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . \\r\\nzero effect is the kind of film that i\\'ll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . \\r\\nat the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . \\r\\nand , with kasdan\\'s undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . \\r\\n'),\n",

only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants . \\r\\ntaran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king\\'s castle from far away . \\r\\ntaran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen . \\r\\nhe manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon . \\r\\nthere , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls . \\r\\nalong the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie . \\r\\nthe three manage to escape the horned king\\'s castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic . \\r\\nas they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen\\'s trail . \\r\\nhe leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks\\' , to a whirlpool . \\r\\nsuddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk . \\r\\ntaran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva . \\r\\nhe then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world . \\r\\nwith the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage . \\r\\nit turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place . \\r\\nwhen taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ?

never to return alive . \\r\\nthings take a turn for the worse when the horned king\\'s henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle . \\r\\ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) . \\r\\njust when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . \\r\\ntaran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away . \\r\\ngurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . \\r\\ntaran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . \\r\\nhe kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . \\r\\ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king\\'s castle just as it self-destructs . \\r\\nthe witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain\\' . \\r\\nin response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . \\r\\nthe trade is made ; gurgi\\'s seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . \\r\\nas taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! \\r\\nthe happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . \\r\\nas spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . \\r\\nbefore ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . \\r\\nbringing this book to the screen was the studio\\'s fondest dream . \\r\\nmiller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . \\r\\nwhen micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . \\r\\nby this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . \\r\\nmany of the studio\\'s old men had retired or died . \\r\\ntherefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . \\r\\noriginally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . \\r\\nthe film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied\\' from lloyd alexander\\'s chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney\\'s other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . \\r\\nin addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart\\' and `unmemorable\\' , compared to other disney animated features . \\r\\nbut whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million . \\r\\nthe failure of the film grounded the studio\\'s animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio\\'s reputation . \\r\\nthe next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn\\'t do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) . \\r\\nonly with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . \\r\\nas for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . \\r\\nfinally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . \\r\\nbecause of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? \\r\\nthe people who had seen the film didn\\'t think so . \\r\\nin fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . \\r\\nfor a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . \\r\\nfew people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn\\'t seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . \\r\\nbut people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . \\r\\nsomewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! \\' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . \\r\\nbefore that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . \\r\\nthose rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . \\r\\neven still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . \\r\\nsome felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn\\'t . \\r\\nbut these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . \\r\\nas for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn\\'t expect much at all . \\r\\nin fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn\\'t think the film would ever be such a good film . \\r\\nmuch to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , \" this is the same film everyone saw ? \\r\\nthe one that flopped at the box office ? \\r\\nthe one that critics and filmgoers alike called \" a bad movie \" ? \\r\\nthis doesn\\'t seem like all of the above . \\r\\ninstead , it\\'s a classic in its own right . \\r\\nthe film has a wonderful cast of characters . \\r\\nthere\\'s taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story\\'s hero . \\r\\nthe critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true . \\r\\nhe is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . \\r\\nthere\\'s a likeable character here ! \\r\\nnot that he\\'s the only likeable character in the film . \\r\\nthere\\'s gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don\\'t quite hit it off at first . \\r\\nbut another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film\\'s imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . \\r\\nthe other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren\\'t quite as well rounded as they should be . \\r\\nthe story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . \\r\\nelmer bernstein\\'s music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . \\r\\nthe animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . \\r\\neven though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . \\r\\noverall ?

it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa\\'s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick\\'s courage under fire . \\r\\nhowever , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino\\'s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it\\'s unconventional . \\r\\nhad the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . \\r\\nas a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . \\r\\nfor the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a \\'70s icon . \\r\\nthis time around , instead of john travolta , it\\'s blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . \\r\\nin one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier\\'s career , tarantino uses a \\'70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . \\r\\nthere are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . \\r\\ngrier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . \\r\\nshe\\'s working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . \\r\\nno longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv\\'s \" banyon \" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . \\r\\njackie passes ordell\\'s test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell\\'s money into the united states without tipping off the feds . \\r\\nsoon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell\\'s perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . \\r\\nunsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn\\'t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . \\r\\nin addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . \\r\\nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . \\r\\nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino\\'s foot fetish . \\r\\nrobert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . \\r\\nthe film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . \\r\\ntarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . \\r\\nwhen it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . \\r\\nit\\'s an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender . \\r\\n'),\n",

s are also the order of the day with mission to mars . \\r\\ndialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it\\'s premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don\\'t like independence day ) . \\r\\nfilms like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that ) . \\r\\nthere is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn\\'t help but whisper \" u\\'tinni \" to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it . \\r\\nthis film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ?

solve a high-profile society murder . \\r\\nevery moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a concept so \" high concept \" that it

. \\r\\nwith a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren\\'t inscribed with \" gotham pd . \" \\r\\nthat being said , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . \\r\\nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane\\'s spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . \\r\\nit is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus\\' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . \\r\\nwhether or not romulus of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . \\r\\nit , along with m . night shyamalan\\'s _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller\\'s seminal \" the dark knight returns \" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . \\r\\nreaders of sam keith\\'s brilliant \" the maxx \" comic series ( or of mtv\\'s short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . \\r\\nthe failure of both \" the maxx \" tv show and of _the caveman\\'s valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america\\'s surprising contributions to dark fantasy . \\r\\nluxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer\\'s ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . \\r\\nkasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve\\'s bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . \\r\\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \\r\\nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \\r\\n_the caveman\\'s valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious

       " Pandas(Index=948, label='pos', review='it\\'s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it\\'s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . \\r\\ni\\'d saw that it\\'s been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i\\'m hardly comparing \" a simple plan \" to , say , \" rear window \" or \" strangers on a train . \" \\r\\nyet it\\'s almost as good . \\r\\nit\\'s simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . \\r\\nelegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , \" a simple plan \" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . \\r\\nwithout anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don\\'t flaunt anything they don\\'t want to flaunt , they\\'ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . \\r\\nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . \\r\\n \" a simple plan , \" though borrows a little from each of these . \\r\\na little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . \\r\\nbut , as austin powers would say , that\\'s not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . \\r\\nwhat i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it\\'s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . \\r\\nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . \\r\\nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . \\r\\nin one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn\\'t look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . \\r\\ninstead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton\\'s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . \\r\\nthere\\'s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he\\'s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching . \\r\\nin short , probably the best piece of direction raimi\\'s ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch \" persona \" \\'s \" sex scene \" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman\\'s ever done ) . \\r\\nbut the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . \\r\\nyet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . \\r\\nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . \\r\\nthere\\'s at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don\\'t come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror . \\r\\nduring the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra \" they can\\'t do this , can they ? \" \\r\\nstreeming through my head . \\r\\nin fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen\\'s [superior , but forget about it] \" fargo , \" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then \\r\\nagain , after seeing the \" evil dead \" films , i\\'d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed \" raimi \" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . \\r\\ninstead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . \\r\\nmost particularly , billy bob thornton\\'s character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . \\r\\nhis dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there\\'s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we\\'re not totally laughing at him . \\r\\nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . \\r\\njacob\\'s a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . \\r\\nthe final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . \\r\\ni particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . \\r\\nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he\\'s ever given and further proof that he\\'s the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don\\'t believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in \" primary colors , \" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn\\'t been in the same year ) because he\\'s easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . \\r\\nhe brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it\\'s difficult picturing anyone else in the role . \\r\\nthe rest of the cast is great too , from paxton\\'s declining working man to chelcie ross\\' amiable town sheriff . \\r\\neven fonda shows off her talents nicely . \\r\\nand if i had any complaints about the film , it\\'s that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . \\r\\nand the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you\\'re trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn\\'t raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . \\r\\nand , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . \\r\\ni won\\'t reveal it , but it\\'s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn\\'t already too much of that anyway . \\r\\nfor a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . \\r\\nimagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it\\'s like if in \" crime and punishment \" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i\\'m at all comparing \" a simple plan \" to dostoevsky . \\r\\nthe ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . \\r\\nbut despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i\\'ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . \\r\\nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\nas in the original film , \" toy story 2 \" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . \\r\\nreportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . \\r\\nthe film is well worth seeing on the big screen . \\r\\nthe colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more \" human . \" \\r\\nthe animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . \\r\\nthere are so many impressive sequences that i\\'d find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al\\' s toy barn , the store owned by woody\\'s captor . \\r\\npixar\\'s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . \\r\\nthe voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . \\r\\ntom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . \\r\\nit was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . \\r\\nall the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . \\r\\nseveral new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . \\r\\n \" toy story 2 \" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . \\r\\nwoody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn\\'t yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . \\r\\nthe new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . \\r\\nit may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it\\'s downright touching . \\r\\nthe script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it\\'s a sequel . \\r\\nthe reason \" toy story 2 \" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original\\'s success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters . \\r\\nnot this one . \\r\\nwe get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . \\r\\n \" toy story 2 \" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . \\r\\nthere is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . \\r\\nthe humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . \\r\\nthere are funny asides to films such as \" star wars \" and \" jurassic park , \" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock \\'em sock \\'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts \" a bug\\'s life \" and the 1997 short \" geri \\'s game . \" \\r\\n ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody\\'s broken arm . ) \\r\\nthe action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . \\r\\n \" toy story 2 \" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . \\r\\nthe more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . \\r\\nit\\'s rare to see a film like \" toy story 2 \" come along , because it\\'s the kind of film that\\'s almost impossible to dislike . \\r\\nit\\'s created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it\\'s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . \\r\\nit\\'s a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing \" toy story 2 . \" it\\'s the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original . \\r\\n'),\n",

       " Pandas(Index=960, label='pos', review='the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of \" leila , \" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . \\r\\nalthough unfamiliar with mehrjui\\'s previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . \\r\\nset in modern-day iran , \" leila \" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . \\r\\nas leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn\\'t quite as sweet . \\r\\nearlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . \\r\\nwhen all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn\\'t care at all about having children . \\r\\nnonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . \\r\\nbluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . \\r\\nleila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens\\' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn\\'t give her full blessing . \\r\\nthere are no easy answers to be found within \" leila , \" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character\\'s unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration . \\r\\nalmost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law\\'s requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . \\r\\nmaybe because \" leila \" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . \\r\\nleila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . \\r\\none of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . \\r\\nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . \\r\\nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . \\r\\nditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . \\r\\nthese \" small \" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . \\r\\nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . \\r\\nrefusing to stay over at her parent\\'s house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . \\r\\ndespite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . \\r\\nsure , the whole second marriage was his mother\\'s idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn\\'t he ? \\r\\nin the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . \\r\\nunlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . \\r\\nevery bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . \\r\\nfor all of its strong aspects , \" leila \" isn\\'t a perfect film . \\r\\non a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . \\r\\nand concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . \\r\\nmehrjui\\'s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . \\r\\ndespite these minor missteps , \" leila \" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york\\'s cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . \\r\\nthe thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila\\'s self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . \\r\\nit\\'s difficult to not consider how leila\\'s culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \\r\\ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , \" blow out , \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \\r\\nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \\r\\nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \\r\\nthen there\\'s koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character\\'s flaws come to life like he did in depalma\\'s earlier \" carlito\\'s way , \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \\r\\nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \\r\\nhe\\'s flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn\\'t so formulaic . \\r\\na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \\r\\nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \\r\\nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \\r\\nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn\\'t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he\\'d be given , and perhaps he\\'d have to make a choice between who\\'s he has to believe . \\r\\nnow there\\'s a film . \\r\\nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we\\'ve seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \\r\\n'),\n",

       " Pandas(Index=990, label='pos', review='it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off . \\r\\nwilde\\'s philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career . \\r\\nthe glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise . \\r\\nthe main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else . \\r\\nand that\\'s why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began . \\r\\nit\\'s been said that todd haynes\\' \" velvet goldmine , \" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from \" citizen kane , \" and that\\'s true . \\r\\nin the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement . \\r\\nstructure-wise , this totally steals from \" kane , \" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours . \\r\\nthis is no \" kane , \" and it really doesn\\'t aspire to be : it doesn\\'t attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like \" kane \" did , and it doesn\\'t really uncover anything poignant about humanity . \\r\\ninstead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants . \\r\\nthe 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging . \\r\\nbut the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy . \\r\\nthey radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that\\'s so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple . \\r\\ninstead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you\\'ve experienced it , everything else seems so mundane . \\r\\nthere\\'s no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack . \\r\\nhaynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors . \\r\\nblade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed . \\r\\nthrough discussions with slade\\'s ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america . \\r\\nhaynes demonstrates that he\\'s quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , \" baby\\'s on fire , \" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film\\'s most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle . \\r\\neven the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie\\'s , have a rare visual flair that\\'s pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool . \\r\\nthe best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era . \\r\\nin it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet . \\r\\nwith brian eno\\'s famous \" needle in the camel\\'s eye \" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn\\'t seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are . \\r\\nit has a distance that\\'s hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film . \\r\\nthis movie\\'s not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being \" style over substance , \" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack . \\r\\nhowever , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film . \\r\\nthe music is especially notable . \\r\\nthe soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade\\'s band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like . \\r\\nthe cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good . \\r\\nalthough eddie izzard , as slade\\'s manager ( who challenges slade\\'s first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles . \\r\\nsome of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes . \\r\\nrhys meyers\\' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl . \\r\\nin fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era . \\r\\nbale\\'s character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he\\'s not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a \" poof \" ) never help us communicate with him . \\r\\nnevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy . \\r\\nat the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union . \\r\\ntheir story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background . \\r\\nthe story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he\\'s the everyman , and when you can\\'t totally identify with the everyman , your story\\'s in slight trouble . \\r\\nas a cultural rock piece , \" velvet goldmine \" is rather good , but it is merely good . \\r\\nit never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies , but then comes back down . \\r\\nit\\'s really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better . \\r\\nthe beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that , it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point ) . \\r\\nand did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ? \\r\\nit almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but not totally so . \\r\\nstill , it does what the oliver stone pic \" the doors \" didn\\'t do right , becoming very insightful to what happened , using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half-assed ( i suppose the message is : \" live life , but after you\\'ve lived it , what else is the point when you\\'ll be forced to live with regretful memories ? \" ) . \\r\\nthe really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down . \\r\\n'),\n",

\\r\\nare history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? \\r\\nthis is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor\\'s alternate-1999 setting . \\r\\nas far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that\\'s the only one i\\'ve seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so . \\r\\nthe animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to . \\r\\nthe oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline . \\r\\nas far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ . \\r\\ni don\\'t think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all . \\r\\nthe cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters\\' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences . \\r\\nthe audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good . \\r\\neven without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side . \\r\\ngiant robot footsteps are deep and booming . \\r\\nthe sometimes-understated , sometimes-blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery . \\r\\nas far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they\\'re among the most easily-readable subtitles i\\'ve ever seen for _anything_ . \\r\\nlarge enough that they don\\'t strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen . \\r\\nalthough it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie . \\r\\nalthough it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people\\'s enjoyment . \\r\\nmy . \\r\\n'),\n",

guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can\\'t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . \\r\\nalan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he\\'s done \" fame , \" \" the committments , \" \" bugsy malone , \" and \" pink floyd the wall \" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . \\r\\nwe cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . \\r\\nhis direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . \\r\\nand there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings \" don\\'t cry for me , argentina , \" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . \\r\\nmadonna\\'s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . \\r\\nat the beginning , she looks like she\\'s too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . \\r\\nher death , though , is brilliant . \\r\\nher singing could be better though . \\r\\ni know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she\\'s trying to hard . \\r\\nshe sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti \\r\\nlupone - i heard her sing on an old \" evita \" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . \\r\\nbut it\\'s generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . \\r\\nantonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i\\'m one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . \\r\\nhis singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . \\r\\nhe does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . \\r\\nand jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . \\r\\nalthough it gets off to a rocky start ( \" rocky \" \\'s polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . \\r\\nlike the other musical released in \\'96 ( woody allen\\'s \" everyone says i love you \" ) , it\\'s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance . \\r\\n'),\n",

a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch . \\r\\nin \" metro \" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble . \\r\\nhis character in \" metro \" takes himself seriously . \\r\\neddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in \" metro , \" and perhaps it is quite better off that way . \\r\\nmurphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator . \\r\\nin the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up . \\r\\nmurphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor . \\r\\nthe film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let

his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning . \\r\\nof course , the writers tried to

\\r\\neveryone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) . \\r\\nthat seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways . \\r\\nin order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors . \\r\\nthese types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out . \\r\\nhow they will all come together is the process the film deals with . \\r\\ni'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general . \\r\\nthe film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come . \\r\\nwe meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent . \\r\\nshe's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works . \\r\\nmaybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed . \\r\\nthings start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences . \\r\\nthis agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug . \\r\\nthe process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death . \\r\\nnearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be . \\r\\nonce the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle . \\r\\nwhen the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling . \\r\\nconsidering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today . \\r\\nand so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting . \\r\\nthe second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead . \\r\\nsimon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined . \\r\\nthe third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle . \\r\\nwe're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna . \\r\\nand many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were . \\r\\ni'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film . \\r\\nperhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking . \\r\\nstill , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well : \\r\\n ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it's a great accomplishment . \\r\\nhe doesn't just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low . \\r\\n ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off . ' \\r\\n ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre . \\r\\nit's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light . ' \\r\\n ? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner . \\r\\n ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we're able to get a sense of who they are , what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations . \\r\\neven when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch . \\r\\n ? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above ) . \\r\\n ? theme/theory : the film doesn't seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages , instead , it's more of a philosophical experiment . \\r\\nin fact , it might not have meant to do that intentionally , but there definitely is something existential to it all . \\r\\n . . . and to think that `go' is just a big comedy and adventure ! \\r\\n ( 4/23/99 ) [see also : `the big lebowski , ' `clerks , ' `jackie brown , ' `pulp fiction , ' `true romance ; ' also by liman : `swingers'] \\r\\n\"),\n",

\\r\\nentering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane . \\r\\nand thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class . \\r\\neven with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes . \\r\\nin contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board . \\r\\nafter jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair . \\r\\nnever tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story . \\r\\nleonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma . \\r\\nin so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part . \\r\\nwhen he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal\\'s supercilious put-downs . \\r\\nkate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose . \\r\\nthe chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what\\'s eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing . \\r\\nfrom the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship\\'s bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances . \\r\\nif the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year . \\r\\npeter lamont\\'s sets are more than authentic . \\r\\none scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck . \\r\\nit then shifts to the ship\\'s massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals . \\r\\nthe handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner . \\r\\neasily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest . \\r\\nat first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else . \\r\\nwhat a lark . \\r\\nwe\\'ve struck an iceberg . \\r\\nnow let\\'s get back to our brandy and cigars . \\r\\nthe ship\\'s musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in . \\r\\nafter all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers . \\r\\nwhen the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it . \\r\\ntheir civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless . \\r\\nthe story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface . \\r\\nthere are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on . \\r\\nspecial effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable . \\r\\nin titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs . \\r\\nthe most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water . \\r\\npeople are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately . \\r\\nbesides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor . \\r\\nfrom the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears . \\r\\n \" it\\'s good-bye for a little while , \" a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first . \\r\\n \" this boat\\'s for mommies and children . \\r\\nthere\\'ll be a boat in a little while for daddies . \" \\r\\nbasically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise . \\r\\nperhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim\\'s on-board the ship . \\r\\nin the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink , he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew . \\r\\n \" no thanks , \" the elegantly attired guggenheim replies . \\r\\n \" we\\'re dressed in our best and would prefer to go down
